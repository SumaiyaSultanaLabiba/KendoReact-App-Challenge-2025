🌿 Quranic Verse Explorer:

 A spiritually resonant React app that lets users explore Quranic verses through natural language search, read and listen to the words of the Supreme Power.



📌 Motivation Behind Choosing This Project: 

Many Quran apps offer keyword-based search, but few allow natural language queries that return only Quranic verses. This app bridges that gap, offering clarity, purity, and spiritual depth.



🧭 App Overview: 

Quranic Verse Explorer is composed of three thoughtfully designed sections: Search, Explorer, and About.

Search: Ask anything about Allah ﷻ, Islam, or the Quran—using natural language. Unlike many platforms that restrict you to keywords, this app understands full questions and returns answers exclusively from Quranic verses. No extra commentary—just the divine response, directly from the source.

Explorer: A visual gateway to all 114 surahs. Each surah card invites you to explore its English translation and listen to its recitation. With a single click, you’re immersed in the message and melody of revelation. When you're done, simply close the view and continue your journey through the Quran.

About: This section includes: A brief introduction about me. Technical details behind the app—including this very write-up. A feedback form powered by Formspree, where you can share your thoughts. I’d love to hear from you!

🌸 My Words: 

This was my first hackathon, and it’s been a deeply rewarding experience. Every bug fixed felt like a small victory. I’m grateful to share this with the developer community. I hope this app becomes a tool for reflection and learning. In future, I’d love to add multilingual support and tafsir integration.
