Surah: Al-Adiyat | Chapter: 100

100|1|By the `Adiyat (steeds), snorting.
100|2|Striking sparks of fire.
100|3|And scouring to the raid at dawn.
100|4|And raise the dust in clouds the while.
100|5|And penetrating forthwith as one into the midst.
100|6|Verily, man is ungrateful to his Lord.
100|7|And to that He bears witness.
100|8|And verily, he is violent in the love of wealth.
100|9|Knows he not that when the contents of the graves are poured forth
100|10|And that which is in the breasts shall be made known
100|11|Verily, that Day their Lord will be Well-Acquainted with them.
