# Surah Al-Qariah
Surah: Al-Qariah | Chapter: 101

101|1|Al-Qari`ah.
101|2|What is Al-Qari`ah
101|3|And what will make you know what Al-Qari`ah is
101|4|It is a Day whereon mankind will be like moths scattered about.
101|5|And the mountains will be like wool, carded.
101|6|Then as for him whose Balance will be heavy,
101|7|He will live a pleasant life.
101|8|But as for him whose Balance will be light,
101|9|His mother will be Hawiyah.
101|10|And what will make you know what it is
101|11|A fire Hamiyah!
