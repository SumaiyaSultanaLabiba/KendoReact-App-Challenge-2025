Surah: At-Takathur | Chapter: 102

102|1|The mutual increase diverts you,
102|2|Until you visit the graves.
102|3|Nay! You shall come to know!
102|4|Again nay! You shall come to know!
102|5|Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge.
102|6|Verily, you shall see the blazing Fire!
102|7|And again, you shall see it with certainty of sight!
102|8|Then on that Day you shall be asked about the delights!
