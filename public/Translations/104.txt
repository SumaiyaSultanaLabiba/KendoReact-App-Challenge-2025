# Surah Al-Humazah
Surah: Al-Humazah | Chapter: 104

104|1|Woe to every Humazah Lumazah.
104|2|Who has gathered wealth and counted it.
104|3|He thinks that his wealth will make him last forever!
104|4|But no! Verily, he will be thrown into Al-Hutamah.
104|5|And what will make you know what Al-Hutamah is
104|6|The fire of Allah, Al-Muqadah,
104|7|Which leaps up over the hearts.
104|8|Verily, it shall Mu'sadah upon them,
104|9|In pillars stretched forth.
