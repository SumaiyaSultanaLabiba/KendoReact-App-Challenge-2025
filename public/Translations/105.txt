# Surah Al-Fil
Surah: Al-Fil | Chapter: 105

105|1|Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant
105|2|Did He not make their plot go astray
105|3|And He sent against them birds, in flocks (Ababil).
105|4|Striking them with stones of Sijjil.
105|5|And He made them like `Asf, Ma'kul.
