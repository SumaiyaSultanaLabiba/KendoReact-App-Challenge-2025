# Surah Al-Maun
Surah: Al-Maun | Chapter: 107

107|1|Have you seen him who denies Ad-Din
107|2|That is he who repulses the orphan,
107|3|And urges not the feeding of Al-Miskin.
107|4|So, woe unto those performers of Salah,
107|5|Those who with their Salah are Sahun.
107|6|Those who do good deeds only to be seen,
107|7|And withhold Al-Ma`un.
