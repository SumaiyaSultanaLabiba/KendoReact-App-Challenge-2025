# Surah An-Nahl
Surah: An-Nahl | Chapter: 16

16|1|The Event ordained by Allah has indeed come, so do not seek to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate as partners with Him.
16|2|He sends down the angels with the Ruh (revelation) of His command to those servants of His whom He wills (saying): "Warn mankind that none has the right to be worshipped but I, so have Taqwa of Me."
16|3|He has created the heavens and the earth with truth. High is He, Exalted above all that they associate as partners with Him.
16|4|He has created man from a Nutfah, then behold, this same (man) becomes an open opponent.
16|5|And the cattle, He has created them for you; in them there is warmth (warm clothing), and numerous benefits, and you eat from them.
16|6|And there is beauty in them for you, when you bring them home in the evening, and as you lead them forth to pasture (in the morning).
16|7|And they carry your loads to a land that you could not reach yourselves except with great trouble. Truly, your Lord is full of kindness, Most Merciful.
16|8|And (He has created) horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride, and as an adornment. And He creates (other) things of which you have no knowledge.
16|9|And it is up to Allah to show the right way. But there are ways that stray. And had He willed, He would have guided you all.
16|10|He it is Who sends water down from the sky; from it you drink and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture.
16|11|With it He causes crops to grow for you, the olives, the date palms, the grapes, and every kind of fruit. Verily, in this there is indeed an evident proof and a manifest sign for people who give thought.
16|12|And He has subjected the night and the day for you, and the sun and the moon; and the stars are subjected by His command. Surely, in this are proofs for people who understand.
16|13|And all He has created of varying colors on the earth for you. Verily, in this is a sign for people who reflect.
16|14|And He it is Who subjected the sea (to you), that you may eat from the fresh tender meat, and that you bring forth out of it ornaments to wear. And you see the ships plowing through it, that you may seek from His bounty and that you may perhaps be grateful.
16|15|And He has driven firm standing mountains into the earth, lest it should shake with you; and rivers and roads, that you may guide yourselves.
16|16|And (by the) landmarks; and by the stars, they guide themselves.
16|17|Is then He Who creates the same as one who creates, not Will you not then reflect
16|18|And if you would try to count the favors of Allah, you would never be able to count them. Truly, Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.
16|19|And Allah knows what you conceal and what you reveal.
16|20|Those whom they invoke besides Allah have not created anything, but are themselves created.
16|21|(They are) dead, not alive; and they do not know when they will be resurrected.
16|22|Your god is one God. But for those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts are in denial, and they are proud.
16|23|Certainly, Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Truly, He does not like the proud.
16|24|And when it is said to them: "What is it that your Lord has revealed" They say: "Tales of the men of old!"
16|25|They will bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear!
16|26|Those before them indeed plotted, but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.
16|27|Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them and will say: "Where are My (so-called) partners, those over which you caused so much discord" Those who have been given the knowledge will say: "Indeed it is a Day of disgrace and misery for the disbelievers."
16|28|Those whose lives the angels take while they are doing wrong to themselves. Then, they will (falsely) submit (saying): "We did not do any evil." (The angels will reply): "Yes! Truly, Allah is Most Knowing of what you did."
16|29|"So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein, and indeed, what an evil abode there is for the arrogant."
16|30|And (when) it is said to those who had Taqwa (piety and righteousness), "What is it that your Lord has revealed" They say: "That which is good." For those who do good in this world, there is good, and the home of the Hereafter will be better. And excellent indeed will be the home (i.e. Paradise) of those who have Taqwa.
16|31|`Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity) which they will enter, under which rivers flow, in it they will have all that they wish. Thus Allah rewards those who have Taqwa.
16|32|Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state saying (to them) "Salamun `Alaikum (peace be on you!). Enter Paradise because of what (good) you used to do (in the world)."
16|33|Are they but waiting for the angels to come to them, or there comes the command of your Lord Thus did those before them. And Allah did not wrong them, but they were wronging themselves.
16|34|Then, they were afflicted by their evil deeds, and they were surrounded by that which they used to mock.
16|35|And those who worshipped others with Allah said: "If Allah had so willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped any but Him nor would we have forbidden anything without (a command from) Him." Those before them did the same. Then! Are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message
16|36|And We have indeed sent a Messenger to every Ummah (community, nation) (saying): "Worship Allah (Alone), and shun the Taghut (all false deities). " Then among them were some whom Allah guided, and among them were some who deserved to be left to stray. So travel through the land and see the end of those who denied (the truth).
16|37|[Even] if you desire that they be guided, then verily, Allah does not guide those whom He allowed to stray, and they will have no helpers.
16|38|And they swear by Allah with their strongest oaths, that Allah will not raise up one who dies. Yes, (He will raise them up), a promise (binding) upon Him in truth, but most of mankind know not.
16|39|In order that He may make clear to them what they differed over, and so that those who disbelieved may know that they were liars.
16|40|Verily, Our Word to a thing when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: "Be!" - and it is.
16|41|And as for those who emigrated for the cause of Allah, after they had been wronged, We will certainly give them good residence in this world, but indeed the reward of the Hereafter will be greater; if they but knew!
16|42|(They are) those who remained patient, and put their trust in their Lord.
16|43|And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) any but men, whom We sent revelation. So ask Ahl Adh-Dhikr, if you know not.
16|44|With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also revealed the Dhikr to you so that you may clearly explain to men what was revealed to them, and that perhaps they may reflect.
16|45|Do then those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not cause them to sink into the earth, or that torment will not seize them from where they do not perceive it
16|46|Or that He may punish them in the midst of their going to and fro (in their livelihood), so that there be no escape for them (from Allah's punishment)
16|47|Or that He may punish them where they fear it most Indeed, Your Lord is full of kindness, Most Merciful.
16|48|Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows shift from right to left, prostrating to Allah while they are humble
16|49|And to Allah prostrate all that are in the heavens and all that are in the earth, the moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they worship their Lord (Allah) with humility].
16|50|They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.
16|51|And Allah said "Do not worship two gods. Indeed, He (Allah) is only One God. Then fear Me Alone.
16|52|To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and the religion. Will you then fear any other than Allah
16|53|And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allah. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cry aloud for help.
16|54|Then, when He has removed the harm from you, behold! some of you associate others in worship with their Lord (Allah).
16|55|So they are ungrateful for that which We have given them! Then enjoy yourselves but you will soon come to know.
16|56|And they assign a portion of that which We have provided them with, to what they have no knowledge of (false deities). By Allah, you shall certainly be questioned about (all) that you used to fabricate.
16|57|And they assign daughters to Allah! Glorified (and Exalted) is He (above all that they associate with Him!). And for themselves (they assign) what they desire;
16|58|And when the news of (the birth of) a female (child) is brought to any of them, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with inner grief!
16|59|He hides himself from the people because of the evil of what he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonor or bury her in the earth Certainly, evil is their decision.
16|60|For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is an evil description, and for Allah is the highest description. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
16|61|And if Allah were to punish (all) mankind for their wrongdoing, He would not leave on it (the earth) a single moving creature, but He defers them to an appointed term; and when their term comes, they can neither delay nor advance it an hour (or a moment).
16|62|They assign to Allah that which they dislike (for themselves), and their tongues assert the lie that the better things will be theirs. No doubt the Fire is for them, and they will be forsaken.
16|63|By Allah, We indeed sent (Messengers) to the nations before you, but Shaytan made their deeds seeming fair to them. So today he is their helper, and theirs will be a painful torment.
16|64|And We have not revealed the Book to you, except that you may clearly explain to them those things in which they differ, and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.
16|65|And Allah sends water down from the sky, then He revives the earth with it after its death. Surely that is a sign for people who listen.
16|66|And there is indeed a lesson for you in the An'am (cattle). We have made a drink for you out of what is in its belly, from between excretions and blood, pure milk; palatable to the drinkers.
16|67|And from the fruits of date palms and grapes, you derive strong drink and a goodly provision. There is indeed a sign in this for those of reason.
16|68|And your Lord inspired the bee, saying: "Take you habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they (humans) erect."
16|69|"Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the routes that your Lord made easy (for you)." There comes forth from their bellies, a drink of varying colors, in which there is a cure for men. There is indeed a sign in that for people who reflect.
16|70|And Allah created you and then He will cause you to die; and among you there are some who are sent back to senility, so that they know nothing after having known (much). Truly, Allah is Knowing, capable of all things.
16|71|And Allah honored some of you over others with wealth and properties. Then, those who are so honored will by no means hand over their wealth and properties to those (captives of war) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in that. Do they then deny the favor of Allah
16|72|And Allah has made for you mates of your own kind, and has made for you, from your mates, sons and grandsons, and has granted you good provisions. Do they then believe in false deities and deny favor of Allah
16|73|And they worship others besides Allah such as do not have power to grant them any provision from the heavens or the earth nor the ability to do so.
16|74|So do not give examples on behalf of Allah. Truly, Allah knows and you know not.
16|75|Allah gives the example of a servant under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort, and a man on whom We have bestowed good provisions from Us, and he spends from that secretly and openly. Can they be equal (By no means). All the praises and thanks are to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them know not.
16|76|And Allah gives an example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything, and he is a burden on his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one who commands justice, and is himself on the straight path
16|77|And to Allah belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Truly, Allah is able to do all things.
16|78|And Allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing. And He gave you hearing, sight, and hearts, that you might give thanks.
16|79|Do they not see the birds held (flying) in the midst of the sky None holds them up but Allah. Verily, in this are clear signs for people who believe.
16|80|And Allah had made your homes a place of rest for you, and made dwellings for you out of the hides of the cattle which you find so light when you travel and when you camp; and furnishings and articles of convenience out of their wool, fur, and hair - comfort for a while.
16|81|And Allah has made shade for you out of that which He has created, and He has made places of refuge in the mountains for you, and He has made garments for you to protect you from the heat, and coats of mail to protect you from your violence. Thus does He perfect His favor for you, that you may submit yourselves to His will.
16|82|Then, if they turn away, your duty (O Muhammad) is only to convey (the Message) in a clear way.
16|83|They recognize the grace of Allah, yet they deny it (by worshipping others besides Allah) and most of them are disbelievers.
16|84|And on the Day when We resurrect a witness from each nation, then those who disbelieve will not be given leave, nor will they be allowed (to return to the world) to repent and ask for Allah's forgiveness.
16|85|And once those who did wrong see the torment, it will not decrease for them, nor will they be given respite.
16|86|And when those who associated partners with Allah see their partners, they will say: "Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to call upon besides you." But they will throw back their statement at them (saying): "You indeed are liars!"
16|87|And they will offer (their full) submission to Allah on that Day, and what they falsely invented will wander away from them.
16|88|Those who disbelieved and tried to obstruct the path of Allah, for them We will add torment on top of the torment because of the corruption they spread.
16|89|And on the Day when We resurrect a witness from each nation from among themselves, and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these. And We have revealed the Book (the Qur'an) to you as an explanation of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and good news for the Muslims.
16|90|Verily, Allah orders justice and kindness, and giving (help) to the relatives, and He forbids immoral sins, and evil and tyranny. He admonishes you, so that perhaps you may take heed.
16|91|And fulfill the covenants (taken in the Name of) Allah when you have taken them, and do not break the oaths after you have confirmed them - and indeed you have appointed Allah as your guarantor. Verily, Allah knows what you do.
16|92|And do not be like the one who undoes the thread which she has spun, after it has become strong, by taking your oaths as a means of deception among yourselves when one group is more numerous than another group. Allah only tests you by this, and on the Day of Resurrection, He will certainly clarify that which used to differ over.
16|93|And had Allah willed, He would have made you (all) one nation, but He allows whom He wills to stray and He guides whom He wills. But you shall certainly be called to account for what you used to do.
16|94|And do not make your oaths a means of deception among yourselves, resulting in the slip of a foot after it was firmly planted, and you taste the evil of having hindered from the path of Allah, and you will suffer a terrible punishment.
16|95|And do not use an oath by Allah for the purchase of little value, what is with Allah is better for you if you only knew.
16|96|Whatever you have will be exhausted, and what is with Allah will remain. And to those who are patient, We will certainly grant them their rewards in proportion to the best of what they used to do.
16|97|Whoever does righteous deeds - whether male or female - while he (or she) is a believer; then We will certainly give them a good life, and We will certainly grant them their rewards in proportion to the best of what they used to do.
16|98|So when you recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast.
16|99|Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord.
16|100|His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Shaytan), and those who join partners with Him (Allah).
16|101|And when We change a verse in place of another - and Allah knows best what He reveals - they (the disbelievers) say: "You (O Muhammad) are but a forger." Rather, most of them know not.
16|102|Say (O Muhammad); "Ruh-ul-Qudus has brought it (the Qur'an) down from your Lord with truth." for the conviction of those who believe, and as a guide and good news for the Muslims.
16|103|And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: "It is only a human being who teaches him." The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while this (the Qur'an) is (in) a clear Arabic tongue.
16|104|Verily, those who do not believe in Allah's Ayat (signs, or revelation), Allah will not guide them, and theirs will be a painful punishment.
16|105|It is only those who do not believe in Allah's Ayat who fabricate the falsehood, and it is they who are liars.
16|106|Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief - except one who was forced while his heart is at peace with the faith - but whoever opens their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a terrible torment.
16|107|That is because they preferred the life of this world over that of the Hereafter. And Allah does not guide the people who disbelieve.
16|108|They are those upon whose hearts, hearing (ears) and sight (eyes) Allah has set a seal over. And they are the heedless!
16|109|No doubt, in the Hereafter they will be the losers.
16|110|Then, verily, your Lord for those who emigrated after they were put to trials and then performed Jihad, and were patient, - after this, your Lord is indeed Forgiving, Most Merciful.
16|111|(Remember) the Day when every person will come pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did, and they will not be dealt with unjustly.
16|112|And Allah gives the example of a township (Makkah), it was secure and peaceful: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the favors of Allah. So Allah made it taste extreme hunger (famine) and fear, because of what they did.
16|113|There has come to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they denied him, so the torment seized them while they were wrongdoers.
16|114|So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah has provided for you. And be grateful for Allah's favor, if it is He Whom you worship.
16|115|He has only forbidden dead flesh, blood, the flesh of swine, and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing, then, Allah is Pardoning, Most Merciful.
16|116|And do not describe what your tongues have lied about, saying: "This is lawful and this is forbidden," to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah, will never succeed.
16|117|A passing brief enjoyment (will be theirs), but they will suffer a painful torment.
16|118|And for those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you before. And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.
16|119|Then, your Lord for those who did evil out of ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds - verily, after that, your Lord is Pardoning, Most Merciful.
16|120|Verily, Ibrahim was (himself) an Ummah, obedient to Allah, a Hanif (monotheist), and he was not one of the idolators.
16|121|(He was) thankful for His favors. He (Allah) chose him and guided him to a straight path.
16|122|And We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous.
16|123|Then, We have sent the revelation to you: "Follow the religion of Ibrahim (he was a) Hanif, and he was not one of the idolators."
16|124|The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it, and verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they differed over.
16|125|Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them with that which is best. Truly, your Lord best knows who has strayed from His path, and He best knows those who are guided.
16|126|And if you punish them, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you have patience with them, then it is better for those who are patient.
16|127|And be patient, and your patience will not be, but by the help of Allah. And do not grieve over them, and do not be distressed by their plots.
16|128|Truly, Allah is with those who have Taqwa, and the doers of good.
