# Surah Bani-Israel
Surah: Bani-Israel | Chapter: 17

17|1|Glorified be He Who took His servant for a Journey by Night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, the neighborhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him of Our Ayat. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.
17|2|And We gave Musa the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel (saying): "Take none other than Me as (your) Wakil."
17|3|"O offspring of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh! Verily, he was a grateful servant."
17|4|And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: "Indeed you would do mischief in the land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!"
17|5|So, when the promise came for the first of the two, We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes. And it was a promise (completely) fulfilled.
17|6|Then We gave you a return of victory over them. And We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower.
17|7|(And We said): "If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves." Then, when the second promise came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces and to enter the Masjid as they had entered it before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that fell in their hands.
17|8|It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you, but if you return (to sins), We shall return (to Our punishment). And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.
17|9|Verily, this Qur'an guides to that which is most just and right and gives good news to those who believe, those who do righteous deeds, that they will have a great reward (Paradise).
17|10|And that those who do not believe in the Hereafter, for them We have prepared a painful torment (Hell).
17|11|And man invokes (Allah) for evil as he invokes (Allah) for good and man is ever hasty.
17|12|And We have appointed the night and the day as two Ayat (signs). Then, We have obliterated the sign of the night (with darkness) while We have made the sign of the day illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years and to count (periods of time). And We have explained everything (in detail) with full explanation.
17|13|And We have fastened every man's Ta'irah (deeds) to his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall bring out for him a Book which he will find wide open.
17|14|(It will be said to him): "Read your Book. You yourself are sufficient as a reckoner against you this Day."
17|15|Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of himself. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray at his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).
17|16|And when We decide to destroy a town (population), Amarna those who live luxuriously. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction.
17|17|And how many generations have We destroyed after Nuh! And sufficient is your Lord as All-Knower and Seer of the sins of His servants.
17|18|Whoever desires the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell; he will burn therein disgraced and rejected.
17|19|And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it while he is a believer, then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated, (rewarded by Allah).
17|20|On each these as well as those We bestow from the bounties of your Lord. And the bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden.
17|21|See how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.
17|22|Set not up with Allah any other ilah (god), or you will sit down reproved, forsaken (in the Hellfire).
17|23|And your Lord has Qada [decreed] that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor reprimand them but address them in terms of honor.
17|24|And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: "My Lord! Bestow on them Your mercy as they did bring me up when I was young."
17|25|Your Lord knows best what is in your souls. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is Ever Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him in repentance.
17|26|And give to the kinsman his due, and to the Miskin (poor), and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.
17|27|Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayatin (devils), and the Shaytan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.
17|28|And if you turn away from them and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft, kind word.
17|29|And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor overextend it (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.
17|30|Truly, your Lord expands the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His servants.
17|31|And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin.
17|32|And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way.
17|33|And do not kill anyone whose killing Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed wrongfully (not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life. Verily, he is helped.
17|34|And come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfill (every) covenant. Verily, the covenant will be questioned about.
17|35|And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end.
17|36|And follow not that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allah).
17|37|And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height.
17|38|All the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.
17|39|This is (part) of Al-Hikmah (wisdom) which your Lord has revealed to you. And set not up with Allah any other god lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allah's mercy).
17|40|Has then your Lord preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself from among the angels daughters Verily, you indeed utter an awful saying.
17|41|And surely, We have explained in this Qur'an that they may take heed, but it increases them in naught save aversion.
17|42|Say: "If there had been other gods along with Him as they assert, then they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne.
17|43|Glorified and Exalted is He high above what they say!
17|44|The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.
17|45|And when you recite the Qur'an, We put between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, an invisible veil.
17|46|And We have put Akinnah over their hearts, lest they should understand it, and in their ears deafness. And when you make mention of your Lord Alone in the Qur'an, they turn on their backs, fleeing in extreme dislike.
17|47|We know best of what they listen to, when they listen to you. And when they take secret counsel, then the wrongdoers say: "You follow none but a bewitched man."
17|48|See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.
17|49|And they say: "When we are bones and fragments (destroyed), should we really be resurrected (to be) a new creation"
17|50|Say: "Be you stones or iron,"
17|51|"Or some created thing that is yet greater (or harder) in your breasts." Then, they will say: "Who shall bring us back (to life)" Say: "He Who created you first!" Then, they will shake their heads at you and say: "When will that be" Say: "Perhaps it is near!"
17|52|On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with (words of) His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed (in this world) but a little while!
17|53|And say to My servants that they should say those words that are best. (Because) Shaytan verily, sows a state of conflict and disagreement among them. Surely, Shaytan is to man a plain enemy.
17|54|Lord knows you best; if He wills, He will have mercy on you, or if He wills, He will punish you. And We have not sent you as a guardian over them.
17|55|And your Lord knows best all who are in the heavens and the earth. And indeed, We have preferred some of the Prophets above others, and to Dawud We gave the Zabur.
17|56|Say: "Call upon those - besides Him whom you pretend. They have neither the power to remove the adversity from you nor even to shift (it from you to another person)."
17|57|Those whom they call upon, desire a means of access to their Lord, as to which of them should be the nearest; and they hope for His mercy and fear His torment. Verily, the torment of your Lord is (something) to be afraid of!
17|58|And there is not a town (population) but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a severe torment. That is written in the Book (of Our decrees)
17|59|And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayat but that the people of old denied them. And We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did her wrong. And We sent not the signs except to make them afraid (of destruction).
17|60|And (remember) when We told you: "Verily, your Lord has encompassed mankind." And We made not the vision which We showed you but a trial for mankind, and (likewise) the accursed tree in the Qur'an. We warn and make them afraid but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allah.
17|61|And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves unto Adam." They prostrated themselves except Iblis. He said: "Shall I prostrate myself to one whom You created from clay"
17|62|He said: "See this one whom You have honored above me, if You give me respite to the Day of Resurrection, I will surely, seize and mislead his offspring, all but a few!"
17|63|(Allah) said: "Go, and whosoever of them follows you, surely, Hell will be the recompense of you (all) an ample recompense.
17|64|"And fool them gradually, those whom you can among them with your voice, Ajlib upon them with your cavalry and your infantry, share with them wealth and children, and make promises to them." But Shaytan promises them nothing but deceit.
17|65|"Verily, My servants, you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian."
17|66|Your Lord is He Who drives the ship for you through the sea, in order that you may seek of His bounty. Truly, He is ever Most Merciful towards you.
17|67|And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon vanish from you except Him. But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away. And man is ever ungrateful.
17|68|Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up, or that He will not send against you a Hasib Then, you shall find no guardian.
17|69|Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea and send against you a Qasif and drown you because of your disbelief Then you will not find any avenger therein against Us.
17|70|And indeed We have honored the Children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea, and have provided them with At-Tayyibat, and have preferred them above many of those whom We have created with a marked preferment.
17|71|(And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam (i.e. the Book of deeds). So whosoever is given his record in his right hand, such will read their records, and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least.
17|72|And whoever is blind in this [world] then he will be blind in the Hereafter, and most astray from the path.
17|73|Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed to you, to fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you as an intimate friend!
17|74|And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little.
17|75|In that case We would have made you taste a double portion in this life and a double portion after death. And then you would have found none to help you against Us.
17|76|And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land. But in that case, they would not have stayed (therein) after you, except for a little while.
17|77|A Sunnah with which We sent Our Messengers before you and you will not find any alteration in Our Sunnah.
17|78|Perform the Salah from midday till the darkness of the night, and recite the Qur'an in the early dawn. Verily, the recitation of the Qur'an in the early dawn is ever witnessed.
17|79|And in some parts of the night (also) offer the Salah with it as an additional prayer for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.
17|80|And say: "My Lord! Let my entry be good, and (likewise) my exit be good. And grant me from You a helping authority,"
17|81|And say: "Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Surely, falsehood is ever bound to vanish."
17|82|And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a cure and a mercy to the believers, and it increases the wrongdoers in nothing but loss.
17|83|And when We bestow Our grace on man, he turns away and becomes arrogant. And when evil touches him, he is in great despair.
17|84|Say: "Each one does according to Shakilatihi, and your Lord knows best of him whose path is right."
17|85|And they ask you concerning the Ruh (the spirit). Say: "The Ruh (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little."
17|86|And if We willed, We could surely take away that which We have revealed to you. Then you would find no protector for you against Us in that respect.
17|87|Except as a mercy from your Lord. Verily, His grace unto you is ever great.
17|88|Say: "If mankind and the Jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another."
17|89|And indeed We have fully explained to mankind, in this Qur'an, every kind of similitude, but most of mankind refuse (the truth and accept nothing) but disbelief.
17|90|And they say: "We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us;"
17|91|"Or you have a garden of date palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly;"
17|92|"Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face;"
17|93|"Or you have a house of Zukhruf, or you ascend up into the sky, and even then we will put no faith in your ascension until you bring down for us a Book that we would read." Say: "Glorified be my Lord! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger"
17|94|And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, except that they said: "Has Allah sent a man as (His) Messenger"
17|95|Say: "If there were on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger."
17|96|Say: "Sufficient is Allah for a witness between me and you. Verily, He is Ever the All-Knower, the All-Seer of His servants."
17|97|And he whom Allah guides, he is led aright; and whomever He leaves astray can never find helpers other than Him, and We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell; whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.
17|98|That is their recompense, because they denied Our Ayat and said: "When we are bones and fragments, shall we really be raised up as a new creation"
17|99|See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the like of them. And He has decreed for them an appointed term, whereof there is no doubt. But the wrongdoers refuse but disbelief.
17|100|Say: "If you possessed the treasure of the mercy of my Lord, then you would surely hold back for fear of spending, and man is ever miserly!"
17|101|And indeed We gave Musa nine clear signs. Ask then the Children of Israel, when he came to them, then Fir`awn said to him: "O Musa! I think you are indeed bewitched."
17|102|He said: "Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth. And I think you are indeed, O Fir`awn, doomed to destruction!"
17|103|So he resolved to turn them out of the land. But We drowned him and all who were with him.
17|104|And We said to the Children of Israel after him: "Dwell in the land, then, when the final and the last promise comes near, We shall bring you altogether as mixed crowd."
17|105|And with truth We have sent it down, and with truth it has descended. And We have sent you as nothing but a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner.
17|106|And a Qur'an which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages.
17|107|Say: "Believe in it or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their chins (faces) in humble prostration."
17|108|And they say: "Glory be to our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled."
17|109|And they fall down on their chins (faces) weeping and it increases their humility.
17|110|Say: "Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names. And offer your Salah (prayer) neither aloud nor in a low voice, but follow a way between.
17|111|And say: "All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has not begotten a son, and Who has no partner in (His) dominion, nor is He low to have a supporter. And magnify Him with all magnificence."
