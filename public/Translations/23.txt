# Surah Al-Muminun
Surah: Al-Muminun | Chapter: 23

23|1|Successful indeed are the believers.
23|2|Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.
23|3|And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.
23|4|And those who pay the Zakah.
23|5|And those who guard their private parts.
23|6|Except from their wives or their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame.
23|7|But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.
23|8|Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants are Ra`un.
23|9|And those who strictly guard their Salawat.
23|10|These are indeed the heirs.
23|11|Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.
23|12|And indeed We created man out of an extract of Tin.
23|13|Thereafter We made him a Nutfah in a safe lodging.
23|14|Then We made the Nutfah into a clot, then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators.
23|15|After that, surely you will die.
23|16|Then (again), surely you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.
23|17|And indeed We have created above you seven Tara'iq, and We are never unaware of the creation.
23|18|And We sent down from the sky water in measure, and We gave it lodging in the earth, and verily, We are able to take it away.
23|19|Then We brought forth for you therewith gardens of date palms and grapes, wherein is much fruit for you, and whereof you eat.
23|20|And a tree that springs forth from Tur Sinai, that grows oil, and relish for the eaters.
23|21|And verily, in the cattle there is indeed a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies. And there are, in them, numerous benefits for you, and of them you eat.
23|22|And on them, and on ships you are carried.
23|23|And indeed We sent Nuh to his people, and he said: "O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him. Will you not then have Taqwa"
23|24|But the chiefs of his people who disbelieved said: "He is no more than a human being like you, he seeks to make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could have sent down angels. Never did we hear such a thing among our fathers of old."
23|25|"He is only a man in whom is madness, so wait for him a while."
23|26|He said: "O my Lord! Help me because they deny me."
23|27|So, We revealed to him: "Construct the ship under Our Eyes and under Our revelation. Then, when Our command comes, and (water) gushes forth from the oven, take on board of each kind two, and your family, except those thereof against whom the Word has already gone forth. And address Me not in favor of those who have done wrong. Verily, they are to be drowned."
23|28|"And when you have embarked on the ship, you and whoever is with you, then say: `All the praise be to Allah, Who has saved us from the people who are wrongdoers."
23|29|"And say: `My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing place, for You are the Best of those who bring to land."'
23|30|Verily, in this, there are indeed Ayat, for sure We are ever putting (men) to the test.
23|31|Then, after them, We created another generation.
23|32|And We sent to them a Messenger from among themselves (saying): "Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him. Will you not then have Taqwa"
23|33|And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting in the Hereafter, and whom We had given the luxuries and comforts of worldly life, said: "He is no more than a human being like you, he eats of that which you eat, and drinks of what you drink."
23|34|"If you were to obey a human being like yourselves, then verily, you indeed would be losers."
23|35|"Does he promise you that when you have died and have become dust and bones, you shall come out alive"
23|36|"Far, very far is that which you are promised!"
23|37|"There is nothing but our life of this world! We die and we live! And we are not going to be resurrected!"
23|38|"He is only a man who has invented a lie against Allah, and we are not going to believe in him."
23|39|He said: "O my Lord! Help me because they deny me."
23|40|(Allah) said: "In a little while, they are sure to be regretful."
23|41|So, the Sayhah overtook them in truth, and We made them as rubbish of dead plants. So, away with the people who are wrongdoers.
23|42|Then, after them, We created other generations.
23|43|No nation can advance their term, nor can they delay it.
23|44|Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him; so, We made them follow one another, and We made them as Ahadith. So, away with a people who believe not!
23|45|Then We sent Musa and his brother Harun, with Our Ayat and manifest authority,
23|46|To Fir`awn and his chiefs, but they behaved insolently and they were people self-exalting (by disobeying their Lord).
23|47|They said: "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves, and their people are obedient to us with humility!"
23|48|So, they denied them both and became of those who were destroyed.
23|49|And indeed We gave Musa the Scripture, that they may be guided.
23|50|And We made the son of Maryam and his mother as a sign, and We gave them refuge on a Rabwah, Dhat Qarar, and Ma`in.
23|51|O Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibat and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well-Acquainted with what you do.
23|52|And verily, this your religion is one religion, and I am your Lord, so have Taqwa."
23|53|But they have broken their religion among them into sects, each group rejoicing in what is with it.
23|54|So, leave them in their error for a time.
23|55|Do they think that in wealth and children with which We prolong them
23|56|We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.
23|57|Verily, those who live in awe for fear of their Lord;
23|58|And those who believe in the Ayat of their Lord;
23|59|And those who join not anyone as partners with their Lord;
23|60|And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear, because they are sure to return to their Lord.
23|61|It is these who hasten in the good deeds, and they are foremost in them.
23|62|And We task not any person except according to his capacity, and with Us is a Record which speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged.
23|63|Nay, but their hearts are covered from this, and they have other deeds, besides which they are doing.
23|64|Until when We seize those of them who lead a luxurious life with punishment; behold, they make humble invocation with a loud voice.
23|65|Invoke not loudly this day! Certainly you shall not be helped by Us.
23|66|Indeed My Ayat used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels.
23|67|In pride, talking evil about it by night.
23|68|Have they not pondered over the Word, or has there come to them what had not come to their fathers of old
23|69|Or is it that they did not recognize their Messenger so they deny him
23|70|Or they say: There is madness in him Nay, but he brought them the truth, but most of them are averse to the truth.
23|71|And if Al-Haqq had followed their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth, and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted! Nay, We have brought them their reminder, but they turn away from their reminder.
23|72|Or is it that you ask them for some Kharj But the recompense of your Lord is better, and He is the Best of those who give sustenance.
23|73|And certainly, you call them to the straight path.
23|74|And verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed deviating far astray from the path.
23|75|And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.
23|76|And indeed We seized them with punishment, but they humbled not themselves to their Lord, nor did they invoke with submission to Him.
23|77|Until, when We open for them the gate of severe punishment, then lo! they will be plunged in despair.
23|78|It is He Who has created for you hearing, eyes, and hearts. Little thanks you give.
23|79|And it is He Who has created you on the earth, and to Him you shall be gathered back.
23|80|And it is He Who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of night and day. Will you not then understand
23|81|Nay, but they say the like of what the men of old said.
23|82|They said: "When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we be resurrected indeed"
23|83|"Verily, this we have been promised -- we and our fathers before! This is only (from) tales of the ancients!") Allah's saying:
23|84|Say: "Whose is the earth and whosoever is therein If you know!"
23|85|They will say: "It is Allah's!" Say: "Will you not then remember"
23|86|Say: "Who is (the) Lord of the seven heavens, and (the) Lord of the Great Throne"
23|87|They will say: "Allah." Say: "Will you not then have Taqwa"
23|88|Say: "In Whose Hand is the sovereignty of everything And He protects, while against Whom there is no protector, if you know"
23|89|They will say: "(All that belongs) to Allah." Say: "How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth"
23|90|Nay, but We have brought them the truth, and verily, they are liars.
23|91|No son (or offspring) did Allah beget, nor is there any god along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allah above all that they attribute to Him!
23|92|All-Knower of the unseen and the seen! Exalted be He over all that they associate as partners to Him!
23|93|Say: "My Lord! If You would show me that with which they are threatened, "
23|94|"My Lord! Then, put me not amongst the people who are the wrongdoers."
23|95|And indeed We are able to show you that with which We have threatened them.
23|96|Repel evil with that which is better. We are best-acquainted with the things they utter.
23|97|And say: "My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the Shayatin."
23|98|"And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me."
23|99|Until, when death comes to one of them, he says: "My Lord! Send me back,"
23|100|"So that I may do good in that which I have left behind!" No! (Kalla) It is but a word that he speaks; and in front of them is Barzakh until the Day when they will be resurrected.
23|101|Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.
23|102|Then, those whose Scales (of good deeds) are heavy, these! they are the successful.
23|103|And those whose Scales (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose themselves, in Hell will they abide.
23|104|The Fire will burn their faces, and therein they will grin, with displaced lips (disfigured).
23|105|"Were not My Ayat recited to you, and then you used to deny them"
23|106|They will say: "Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people."
23|107|"Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers."
23|108|He (Allah) will say: "Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!"
23|109|Verily, there was a party of My servants who used to say: "Our Lord! We believe, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of all who show mercy!"
23|110|But you took them for a laughing stock, so much so that they made you forget My remembrance while you used to laugh at them!
23|111|Verily, I have rewarded them this Day for their patience; they are indeed the ones that are successful.
23|112|He will say: "What number of years did you stay on earth"
23|113|They will say: "We stayed a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep account."
23|114|He will say: "You stayed not but a little, if you had only known!"
23|115|"Did you think that We had created you in play, and that you would not be brought back to Us"
23|116|So Exalted be Allah, the True King: None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of Al-`Arsh Al-Karim!
23|117|And whoever invokes besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, disbelievers will not be successful.
23|118|And say: "My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the Best of those who show mercy!"
