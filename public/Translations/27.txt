# Surah An-Naml
Surah: An-Naml | Chapter: 27

27|1|Ta Sin. These are the Ayat of the Qur'an, and (it is) a Book (that is) clear.
27|2|A guide and glad tidings for the believers.
27|3|Those who perform the Salah and give the Zakah and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter.
27|4|Verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds fair seeming to them, so that they wander about blindly.
27|5|They are those for whom there will be an evil torment. And in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers.
27|6|And verily, you are being taught the Qur'an from One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.
27|7|(Remember) when Musa said to his household: "Verily, I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning ember, that you may warm yourselves."
27|8|But when he came to it, he was called: "Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it! And glorified be Allah, the Lord of all that exists."
27|9|"O Musa! Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise."
27|10|"And throw down your stick!" But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and did not look back. (It was said:) "O Musa! Fear not: verily, the Messengers fear not in front of Me."
27|11|"Except him who has done wrong and afterwards has changed evil for good; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
27|12|"And put your hand into opening of your garment, it will come forth white without hurt. (These are) among the nine signs (you will take) to Fir`awn and his people. Verily, they are a people who are rebellious."
27|13|But when Our Ayat came to them, clear to see, they said: "This is a manifest magic."
27|14|And they belied them wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof. So, see what was the end of the mischief-makers.
27|15|And indeed We gave knowledge to Dawud and Sulayman, and they both said: "All praise be to Allah, Who has preferred us above many of His believing servants!"
27|16|And Sulayman inherited from Dawud. He said: "O mankind! We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from everything. This, verily, is an evident grace."
27|17|And there were gathered before Sulayman his hosts of Jinn and men, and birds, and they all were set in battle order (marching forward).
27|18|Till, when they came to the valley of the ants, one of the ants said: "O ants! Enter your dwellings, lest Sulayman and his armies should crush you, while they perceive not."
27|19|So he (Sulayman) smiled, amused at her speech and said: "My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your favors which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds that will please You, and admit me by Your mercy among Your righteous servants."
27|20|He inspected the birds, and said: "What is the matter that I see not the hoopoe Or is he among the absentees"
27|21|"I will surely punish him with a severe torment or slaughter him, unless he brings me a clear reason."
27|22|But (the hoopoe) stayed not long, he said: "I have grasped which you have not grasped and I have come to you from Saba' with true news."
27|23|"I found a woman ruling over them, she has been given all things, and she has a great throne."
27|24|"I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them to prevent them from the way, so they have no guidance."
27|25|So they do not prostrate themselves before Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal.
27|26|Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!"
27|27|(Sulayman) said: "We shall see whether you speak the truth or you are (one) of the liars."
27|28|"Go you with this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then draw back from them and see what they return."
27|29|She said: "O chiefs! Verily, here is delivered to me a noble letter, "
27|30|"Verily, it is from Sulayman, and it (reads): `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful;'
27|31|`Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting (as Muslims).' "
27|32|She said: "O chiefs! Advise me in case of mine. I decide no case till you are present with me."
27|33|They said: "We have great strength, and great ability for war, but it is for you to command; so think over what you will command."
27|34|She said: "Verily, kings, when they enter a town, they destroy it and make the most honorable among its people the lowest. And thus they do."
27|35|"But verily, I am going to send him a present, and see with what (answer) the messengers return."
27|36|So, when (the messengers with the gift) came to Sulayman, he said: "Will you help me in wealth What Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay, you rejoice in your gift!"
27|37|"Go back to them. We verily, shall come to them with armies that they cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace, and they will be abased."
27|38|He said: "O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience (as Muslims)"
27|39|An `Ifrit from the Jinn said: "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place. And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work."
27|40|One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture, said: "I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!" Then when he saw it placed before him, he said: "This is by the grace of my Lord -- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for himself; and whoever is ungrateful, certainly my Lord is Rich, Bountiful."
27|41|He said: "Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will be guided, or she will be one of those not guided."
27|42|So when she came, it was said, "Is your throne like this" She said: "As though it were the very same." And he said, "Knowledge was bestowed on us before her, and we had submitted to Allah (as Muslims)."
27|43|And Saddaha that which she used to worship besides Allah has prevented her (from Islam), for she was of a disbelieving people.
27|44|It was said to her: "Enter As-Sarh," but when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (tucked up her clothes) uncovering her legs. Sulayman said: "Verily, it is a Sarh Mumarrad of Qawarir." She said: "My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, and I submit, together with Sulayman to Allah, the Lord of all that exits."
27|45|And indeed We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, (saying): "Worship Allah." Then look! They became two parties quarreling with each other.
27|46|He said: "O my people! Why do you seek to hasten the evil before the good Why seek you not the forgiveness of Allah, that you may receive mercy"
27|47|They said: "We augur an omen from you and those with you." He said: "Your omen is of Allah; nay, but you are a people that are being tested."
27|48|And there were in the city nine Rahtin, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform.
27|49|They said: "Swear one to another by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his household, and thereafter we will surely say to his near relatives: `We witnessed not the destruction of his household, and verily, we are telling the truth."'
27|50|So, they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.
27|51|Then see how was the end of their plot! Verily, We destroyed them and their nation all together.
27|52|These are their houses in utter ruin, for they did wrong. Verily, in this is indeed an Ayah for people who know.
27|53|And We saved those who believed, and had Taqwa of Allah.
27|54|And (remember) Lut! When he said to his people: "Do you commit immoral sins while you see"
27|55|"Do you practice your lusts on men instead of women Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly."
27|56|There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: "Drive out the family of Lut from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!"
27|57|So, We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind.
27|58|And We rained down on them a rain. So, evil was the rain of those who were warned.
27|59|Say: "Praise and thanks be to Allah, and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen! Is Allah better, or what they ascribe as partners"
27|60|Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allah Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals!
27|61|Is not He Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water) Is there any ilah (god) with Allah Nay, but most of them know not!
27|62|Is not He Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations Is there any god with Allah Little is that you remember!
27|63|Is not He Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy Is there any god with Allah Exalted be Allah above all that they associate as partners!
27|64|Is not He Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth Is there any god with Allah Say: "Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful."
27|65|Say: "None in the heavens and the earth knows the Unseen except Allah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected."
27|66|Nay, their knowledge will perceive that in the Hereafter. Nay, they are in doubt about it. Nay, they are in complete blindness about it.
27|67|And those who disbelieve say: "When we have become dust -- we and our fathers -- shall we really be brought forth"
27|68|"Indeed we were promised this -- we and our forefathers before, verily, these are nothing but tales of ancients."
27|69|Say to them: "Travel in the land and see how has been the end of the criminals."
27|70|And grieve you not over them, nor be straitened (in distress) because of what they plot.
27|71|And they say: "When this promise, if you are truthful"
27|72|Say: "Perhaps that which you wish to hasten on, may be close behind you."
27|73|Verily, your Lord is full of grace for mankind, yet most of them do not give thanks.
27|74|And verily, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal.
27|75|And there is nothing hidden in the heaven and the earth but it is in a Clear Book.
27|76|Verily, this Qur'an narrates to the Children of Israel most of that in which they differ.
27|77|And truly, it is a guide and a mercy for the believers.
27|78|Verily, your Lord will decide between them by His judgement. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.
27|79|So, put your trust in Allah; surely, you are on manifest truth.
27|80|Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear nor can you make the deaf to hear the call, when they flee, turning their backs.
27|81|Nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can only make to hear those who believe in Our Ayat, so they submit (became Muslims).
27|82|And when the Word is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast for them, to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayat.
27|83|And (remember) the Day when We shall gather out of every nation a Fawj of those who denied Our Ayat, and they shall be driven,
27|84|Till, when they come, He will say: "Did you deny My Ayat whereas you comprehended them not by knowledge, or what was it that you used to do"
27|85|And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because they have done wrong, and they will be unable to speak.
27|86|See they not that We have made the night for them to rest therein, and the day sight-giving Verily, in this are Ayat for the people who believe.
27|87|And (remember) the Day on which the Trumpet (Sur) will be blown -- and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth, will be terrified except him whom Allah wills. And all shall come to Him, humbled.
27|88|And you will see the mountains and think them solid, but they shall pass away as the passing away of the clouds. The work of Allah, Who perfected all things, verily, He is well-acquainted with what you do.
27|89|Whoever brings a good deed, will have better than its worth; and they will be safe from the terror on that Day.
27|90|And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. (And it will be said to them) "Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do"
27|91|I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this city, Who has sanctified it and to Whom belongs everything. And I am commanded to be from among the Muslims.
27|92|And that I should recite the Qur'an, then whosoever receives guidance, receives it for the good of himself; and whosoever goes astray, say (to him): "I am only one of the warners."
27|93|And say: "All the praises and thanks be to Allah. He will show you His Ayat, and you shall recognize them. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do."
