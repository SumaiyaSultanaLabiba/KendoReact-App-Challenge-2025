# Surah Al-Saba
Surah: Al-Saba | Chapter: 34

34|1|All praise is due to Allah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. His is all praise in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.
34|2|He knows that which goes into the earth and that which comes forth from it, and that which descends from the heaven and that which ascends to it. And He is the Most Merciful, the Oft-Forgiving.
34|3|Those who disbelieve say: "The Hour will not come to us." Say: "Yes, by my Lord, the All-Knower of the Unseen, it will come to you; not even the weight of a speck of dust or less than that or greater escapes His knowledge in the heavens or in the earth but it is in a Clear Book."
34|4|That He may recompense those who believe and do righteous good deeds. Those, theirs is forgiveness and generous provision.
34|5|But those who strive against Our Ayat to frustrate them -- those, for them will be a severe painful torment.
34|6|And those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and that it guides to the path of the Exalted in might, Owner of all praise.
34|7|Those who disbelieve say: "Shall we direct you to a man who will tell you (that) when you have become fully disintegrated into dust with full dispersion, then you will be created (again) anew"
34|8|Has he invented a lie against Allah, or is there a madness in him Nay, but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are (themselves) in a torment, and in far error.
34|9|See they not what is before them and what is behind them, of the heaven and the earth If We will, We shall sink the earth with them, or cause a piece of the heaven to fall upon them. Verily, in this is a sign for every servant who turns (to Allah) in repentance.
34|10|And indeed We bestowed grace on Dawud from Us (saying): "O you mountains! Glorify with him! And you birds (also)! And We made the iron soft for him."
34|11|Saying: "Make you perfect coats of mail, and balance well the rings of chain armor [Sard], and work you (men) righteousness. Truly, I am All-Seer of what you do."
34|12|And to Sulayman (We subjected) the wind, its morning was a month's (journey), and its afternoon was a month's (journey). And We caused a fount of Qitr to flow for him, and there were Jinn that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord. And whosoever of them turned aside from Our command, We shall cause him to taste of the torment of the blazing Fire.
34|13|They worked for him as he desired on Maharib, Tamathil, large basins like Jawab and Qudur Rasiyat. "Work you, O family of Dawud, with thanks!" But few of My servants are grateful.
34|14|Then when We decreed death for him, nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the Jinn saw clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment.
34|15|Indeed there was for Saba' a sign in their dwelling place -- two gardens on the right and on the left; (and it was said to them:) "Eat of the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him." A fair land and an Oft-Forgiving Lord!
34|16|But they turned away, so We sent against them flood released from the dam, and We converted their two gardens into gardens producing bitter bad fruit, and Athl, and some few lote trees.
34|17|Like this We requited them because they were ungrateful disbelievers. And never do We requite in such a way except those who are ungrateful (disbelievers).
34|18|And We placed, between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy to be seen, and We made the stages (of journey) between them easy (saying): "Travel in them safely both by night and day."
34|19|But they said: "Our Lord! Make the stages between our journey longer," and they wronged themselves; so We made them as tales (in the land), and We dispersed them all totally. Verily, in this are indeed signs for every steadfast, grateful (person).
34|20|And indeed Iblis did prove true his thought about them, and they followed him, all except a group of true believers.
34|21|And he had no authority over them, -- except that We might test him who believes in the Hereafter, from him who is in doubt about it. And your Lord is Watchful over everything.
34|22|Say: "Call upon those whom you assert besides Allah, they possess not even the weight of a speck of dust, either in the heavens or on the earth, nor have they any share in either, nor there is for Him any supporter from among them. "
34|23|Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits. So much so that when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: "What is it that your Lord has said" They say the truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.
34|24|Say: "Who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth" Say: "Allah. And verily, (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error."
34|25|Say: "You will not be asked about our sins, nor shall we be asked of what you do."
34|26|Say: "Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs."
34|27|Say: "Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners. Nay! But He is Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise."
34|28|And We have not sent you except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, and most of men know not.
34|29|And they say: "When is this promise if you are truthful"
34|30|Say: "The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward."
34|31|And those who disbelieve say: "We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that which was before it." But if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, how they will cast the (blaming) word one to another! Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: "Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers!"
34|32|And those who were arrogant will say to those who were deemed weak: "Did we keep you back from guidance after it had come to you Nay, but you were criminals."
34|33|Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: "Nay, but it was your plotting by night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals to Him!" And each of them (parties) will conceal their own regrets, when they behold the torment. And We shall put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught except what they used to do
34|34|And We did not send a warner to a township but those who were given the worldly wealth and luxuries among them said: "We believe not in what you have been sent with."
34|35|And they say: "We are more in wealth and in children, and we are not going to be punished."
34|36|Say: "Verily, my Lord expands the provision to whom He wills and restricts, but most men know not."
34|37|And it is not your wealth, nor your children that bring you nearer to Us, but only he who believes, and does righteous deeds; as for such, there will be multiple rewards for what they did, and they will reside in the high dwellings (Paradise) in peace and security.
34|38|And those who strive against Our Ayat, to frustrate them, they will be brought to the torment.
34|39|Say: "Truly, my Lord expands the provision for whom He wills of His servants, and (also) restricts (it) for him, and whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it." And He is the Best of those who make provision.
34|40|And (remember) the Day when He will gather them all together, then He will say to the angels: "Was it you that these people used to worship"
34|41|They (the angels) will say: "Glorified be You! You are our Protector instead of them. Nay, but they used to worship the Jinn; most of them were believers in them."
34|42|So Today, none of you can profit or harm one another. And We shall say to those who did wrong: "Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to deny."
34|43|And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, they say: "This is naught but a man who wishes to hinder you from that which your fathers used to worship." And they say: "This is nothing but an invented lie." And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them: "This is nothing but evident magic!"
34|44|And We had not given them Scriptures that they could study, nor sent to them before you any warner.
34|45|And those before them denied; these have not received even a tenth of what We had granted to those (of old); yet they denied My Messengers. Then how (terrible) was My denial!
34|46|Say: "I exhort you to one (thing) only, that you stand up for Allah's sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment."
34|47|Say: "Whatever wage I might have asked of you is yours. My wage is from Allah only, and He is a Witness over all things."
34|48|Say: "Verily, my Lord sends down the truth, the All-Knower of the Unseen."
34|49|Say: "The truth has come, and the falsehood can neither create anything nor resurrect."
34|50|Say: "If (even) I go astray, I shall stray only to my own loss. But if I remain guided, it is because of the Revelation of my Lord to me. Truly, He is All-Hearer, Ever Near."
34|51|And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place.
34|52|And they will say: "We do believe (now);" but how could they receive (Tanawush) from a place so far off.
34|53|Indeed they did disbelieve before (in this world), and they (used to) conjecture about the Unseen, from a far place.
34|54|And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind. Verily, they have been in grave doubt.
