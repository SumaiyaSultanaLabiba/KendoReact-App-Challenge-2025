# Surah As-Saffat
Surah: As-Saffat | Chapter: 37

37|1|By those ranged in ranks.
37|2|By those who drive the clouds in a good way.
37|3|By those who bring the Dhikr.
37|4|Verily, your God is indeed One;
37|5|Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and all that is between them, and Lord of every point of the sun's risings.
37|6|Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars.
37|7|And to guard against every rebellious Shaytan.
37|8|They cannot listen to the higher group for they are pelted from every side.
37|9|Outcast, and theirs is a constant torment.
37|10|Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.
37|11|Then ask them: "Are they harder to create, or those whom We have created" Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.
37|12|Nay, you wondered while they mock.
37|13|And when they are reminded, they pay no attention.
37|14|And when they see an Ayah (a sign) from Allah, they mock at it.
37|15|And they say: "This is nothing but evident magic!"
37|16|"When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we verily be resurrected"
37|17|"And also our fathers of old"
37|18|Say: "Yes, and you shall then be humiliated."
37|19|It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!
37|20|They will say: "Woe to us! This is the Day of Recompense!"
37|21|(It will be said:) "This is the Day of Judgement which you used to deny."
37|22|(It will be said to the angels:) Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions and what they used to worship,
37|23|Instead of Allah, and lead them on to the way of flaming Fire (Hell);
37|24|But stop them, verily, they are to be questioned.
37|25|"What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another"
37|26|Nay, but that Day they shall surrender.
37|27|And they will turn to one another and question one another.
37|28|They will say: "It was you who used to come to us from the right side."
37|29|They will reply: "Nay, you yourselves were not believers."
37|30|"And we had no authority over you. Nay! But you were a transgressing people."
37|31|"So now the Word of our Lord has been justified against us, that we shall certainly taste (the torment)."
37|32|"So we led you astray because we were ourselves astray."
37|33|Then verily, that Day, they will (all) share in the torment.
37|34|Certainly, that is how We deal with the criminals.
37|35|Truly, when it was said to them: "La ilaha illallah," they puffed themselves up with pride.
37|36|And (they) said: "Are we going to abandon our gods for the sake of a mad poet"
37|37|Nay! he has come with the truth and he confirms the Messengers.
37|38|Verily, you are going to taste the painful torment;
37|39|And you will be requited nothing except for what you used to do.
37|40|Save the chosen servants of Allah.
37|41|For them there will be a known provision,
37|42|Fruits; and they shall be honored,
37|43|In the Gardens of Delight,
37|44|Facing one another on thrones.
37|45|Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine
37|46|White, delicious to the drinkers.
37|47|Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.
37|48|And beside them will be Qasirat-At-Tarf with (wide and beautiful) eyes.
37|49|as if they were Bayd Maknun.
37|50|Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning.
37|51|A speaker of them will say: "Verily, I had a companion (in the world),"
37|52|"Who used to say: `Are you among those who believe.
37|53|(That) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be indebted (Madinun)"'
37|54|(The speaker) said: "Will you look down"
37|55|So he looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire.
37|56|He said: "By Allah! You have nearly ruined me."
37|57|"Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell)."
37|58|"Are we then not to die (any more)"
37|59|"Except our first death, and we shall not be punished"
37|60|Truly, this is the supreme success!
37|61|For the like of this let the workers work.
37|62|Is that (Paradise) better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
37|63|Truly, We have made it (as) a trial for the wrongdoers.
37|64|Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire,
37|65|The shoots of its fruit stalks are like the heads of Shayatin.
37|66|Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.
37|67|Then on the top of that they will be given boiling Hamim.
37|68|Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.
37|69|Verily, they found their fathers on the wrong path;
37|70|So they (too) hastened in their footsteps!
37|71|And indeed most of the earlier ones went astray before them;
37|72|And indeed We sent among them warners;
37|73|Then see what was the end of those who were warned.
37|74|Except the chosen servants of Allah.
37|75|And indeed Nuh invoked Us, and We are the best of those who answer.
37|76|And We rescued him and his family from the great distress,
37|77|And, his progeny, them We made the survivors.
37|78|And left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations
37|79|"Salam (peace!) be upon Nuh among the all creatures!"
37|80|Verily, thus We reward the gooddoers.
37|81|Verily, he [Nuh] was one of Our believing servants.
37|82|Then We drowned the others.
37|83|And verily, among those who followed his way was Ibrahim.
37|84|When he came to his Lord with a Salim heart.
37|85|When he said to his father and to his people: "What is it that which you worship"
37|86|"Is it a falsehood -- gods other than Allah -- that you desire"
37|87|"Then what think you about the Lord of the all that exists"
37|88|Then he cast a glance at the stars,
37|89|And he said: "Verily, I am sick."
37|90|So they turned away from him and departed.
37|91|Then he turned to their gods and said: "Will you not eat"
37|92|"What is the matter with you that you speak not"
37|93|Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand.
37|94|Then they came hastily towards him.
37|95|He said: "Worship you that which you (yourselves) carve"
37|96|"While Allah has created you and what you make!"
37|97|They said: "Build for him a building and throw him into the blazing fire!"
37|98|So, they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest.
37|99|And he said: "Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me!"
37|100|"My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous."
37|101|So, We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.
37|102|And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: "O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!" He said: "O my father! Do that which you are commanded, if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient."
37|103|Then, when they had both submitted themselves, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead;
37|104|We called out to him: "O Ibrahim!"
37|105|"You have fulfilled the dream!" Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.
37|106|Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.
37|107|And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice;
37|108|And We left for him among the later generations.
37|109|"Salam (peace!) be upon Ibrahim!"
37|110|Thus indeed do We reward the doers of good.
37|111|Verily, he was one of Our believing servants.
37|112|And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq -- a Prophet from the righteous.
37|113|We blessed him and Ishaq. And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.
37|114|And, indeed We gave Our grace to Musa and Harun.
37|115|And We saved them and their people from the great distress,
37|116|And helped them, so that they became the victors;
37|117|And We gave them the clear Scripture;
37|118|And guided them to the right path.
37|119|And We left for them among the later generations.
37|120|"Salam (peace!) be upon Musa and Harun!"
37|121|Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.
37|122|Verily, they were two of Our believing servants.
37|123|And verily, Ilyas was one of the Messengers.
37|124|When he said to his people: "Will you not have Taqwa"
37|125|"Will you call upon `Ba`l and forsake the Best of creators,
37|126|Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers"
37|127|But they denied him, so they will certainly be brought forth,
37|128|Save the chosen servants of Allah.
37|129|And We left for him among the later generations.
37|130|"Salam (peace!) be upon Ilyasin!"
37|131|Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good.
37|132|Verily, he was one of Our believing servants.
37|133|And verily, Lut was one of the Messengers.
37|134|When We saved him and his family, all,
37|135|Except an old woman (his wife) who was among those who remained behind.
37|136|Then We destroyed the rest.
37|137|Verily, you pass by them in the morning.
37|138|And at night; will you not then reflect
37|139|And verily, Yunus was one of the Messengers.
37|140|When he ran to the laden ship:
37|141|Then he (agreed to) cast lots, and he was among the losers.
37|142|Then a (big) fish swallowed him as he had done an act worthy of blame.
37|143|Had he not been of them who glorify Allah,
37|144|He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.
37|145|But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick,
37|146|And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.
37|147|And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more.
37|148|And they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while.
37|149|Now ask them: "Are there (only) daughters for your Lord and sons for them"
37|150|Or did We create the angels female while they were witnesses
37|151|Verily, it is of their falsehood that they say:
37|152|"Allah has begotten." And, verily, they are liars!
37|153|Has He (then) chosen daughters rather than sons
37|154|What is the matter with you How do you decide
37|155|Will you not then remember
37|156|Or is there for you a plain authority
37|157|Then bring your Book if you are truthful!
37|158|And they have invented a kinship between Him and the Jinn, but the Jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him).
37|159|Glorified be Allah! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him!
37|160|Except the servants of Allah, whom He chooses.
37|161|So, verily you and those whom you worship
37|162|Cannot lead astray,
37|163|Except those who are predestined to burn in Hell!
37|164|And there is not one of us (angels) but has his known place;
37|165|And verily, we (angels), we stand in rows;
37|166|And verily, we (angels) indeed are those who glorify.
37|167|And indeed they used to say:
37|168|"If we had a reminder as had the men of old,"
37|169|"We would have indeed been the chosen servants of Allah!"
37|170|But (now) they disbelieve therein, so they will come to know!
37|171|And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers,
37|172|That they verily would be made triumphant,
37|173|And that Our hosts! they verily would be the victors.
37|174|So, turn away from them for a while,
37|175|And watch them and they shall see!
37|176|Do they seek to hasten on Our torment
37|177|Then, when it descends in their courtyard, evil will be the morning for those who had warned!
37|178|So, turn away from them for a while,
37|179|And watch and they shall see!
37|180|Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Al-`Izzah! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him!
37|181|And Salam (peace!) be on the Messengers!
37|182|And all the praises and thanks be to Allah, Lord of all that exists.
