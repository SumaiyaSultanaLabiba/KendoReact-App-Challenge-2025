# Surah Sad
Surah: Sad | Chapter: 38

38|1|Sad. By the Qur'an full of reminding.
38|2|Those who disbelieve are in false pride and opposition.
38|3|How many a generation have We destroyed before them! And they cried out when there was no longer time for escape.
38|4|And they wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves. And the disbelievers say: "This is a sorcerer, a liar."
38|5|"Has he made the gods into One God. Verily, this is a curious thing!"
38|6|And the leaders among them went about (saying): "Go on, and remain constant to your gods! Verily, this is a thing designed!"
38|7|"We have not heard (the like) of this in the religion of these later days. This is nothing but an invention!"
38|8|"Has the Reminder been sent down to him (alone) from among us" Nay, but they are in doubt about My Reminder! Nay, but they have not tasted (My) torment!
38|9|Or have they the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Almighty, the Real Bestower
38|10|Or is it that the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them is theirs If so, let them ascend up with means!
38|11|They will be a defeated host like the Confederates of the old times.
38|12|Before them denied -- the people of Nuh; and `Ad; and Fir`awn the man of stakes,
38|13|And Thamud, and the people of Lut, and the Dwellers of Al-Aykah; such were the Confederates.
38|14|Not one of them but denied the Messengers; therefore My torment was justified.
38|15|And these only wait for a single Sayhah there will be no pause or ending thereto.
38|16|They say: "Our Lord! Hasten to us Qittana before the Day of Reckoning!"
38|17|Be patient of what they say and remember Our slave Dawud, endued with Al-Ayd. Verily, he was ever oft-returning in all matters and in repentance.
38|18|Verily, We made the mountains to glorify Our praises with him in the `Ashi and Ishraq.
38|19|And (so did) the birds assembled, all obedient to him.
38|20|We made his kingdom strong and gave him Al-Hikmah and sound judgement in speech and decision.
38|21|And has the news of the litigants reached you When they climbed over the wall into (his) Mihrab (private chamber of worship);
38|22|When they entered in upon Dawud, he was terrified of them. They said: "Fear not! (We are) two litigants, one of us has wronged the other, therefore judge between us with truth, and treat us not with injustice, and guide us to the right way.
38|23|Verily, this my brother (in religion) has ninety-nine ewes, while I have (only) one ewe, and he says: "Hand it over to me, and he overpowered me in speech."
38|24|[Dawud] said: "He has wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his ewes. And, verily, many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and they are few." And Dawud guessed that We have tried him and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance.
38|25|So, We forgave him that, and verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good place of return.
38|26|O Dawud! Verily, We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth (and justice) and follow not your desire -- for it will mislead you from the path of Allah. Verily, those who wander astray from the path of Allah (shall) have a severe torment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning.
38|27|And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!
38|28|Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous good deeds as those who cause mischief on the earth Or shall We treat those who have Taqwa as the evildoers
38|29|(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.
38|30|And to Dawud We gave Sulayman. How excellent a servant! Verily, he was ever turning in repentance (to Us)!
38|31|When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well trained horses of the highest breed.
38|32|He said: "I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord," till the time was over, and (the sun) had hidden in the veil (of night).
38|33|Then he said: "Bring them back to me." Then he began to pass his hand over their legs and their necks.
38|34|And indeed, We tried Sulayman and We placed on his throne Jasad (a body), and he returned.
38|35|He said: "My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me. Verily, You are the Bestower."
38|36|So, We subjected to him the wind; it blew gently by his order wherever he willed,
38|37|And the Shayatin, from every kind of builder and diver,
38|38|And also others bound in fetters.
38|39|[Allah said to Sulayman]: "This is Our gift, so spend you or withhold, no account will be asked of you."
38|40|And verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good (final) return.
38|41|And remember Our servant Ayyub, when he invoked his Lord (saying): "Verily, Shaytan has afflicted me with distress and torment!"
38|42|(Allah said to him): "Strike the ground with your foot. This is (a spring of) water to wash in, cool and a drink."
38|43|And We gave him (back) his family, and along with them the like thereof, as a mercy from Us, and a reminder for those who understand.
38|44|"And take in your hand a bundle of thin grass and strike therewith (your wife), and break not your oath." Truly, We found him patient. How excellent a servant! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!
38|45|And remember Our servants, Ibrahim, Ishaq, and Ya`qub, Ulil-Aydi wal-Absar.
38|46|Verily, We did choose them by granting them the remembrance of the Abode.
38|47|And they are with Us, verily, of the chosen and the best!
38|48|And remember Isma`il, Al-Yasa`, and Dhul-Kifl, all are among the best.
38|49|This is a Reminder. And verily, for those who have Taqwa is a good final return.
38|50|`Adn Paradise, whose doors will be opened for them.
38|51|Therein they will recline; therein they will call for fruits in abundance and drinks;
38|52|And beside them will be Qasirat-at-Tarf, (and) of equal ages.
38|53|This it is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning!
38|54|(It will be said to them)! Verily, this is Our provision which will never finish.
38|55|This is so! And for the Taghin will be an evil final return.
38|56|Hell! Where they will enter it, and worst (indeed) is that place to rest!
38|57|This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq.
38|58|And other of similar kind - all together!
38|59|This is a troop entering with you (in Hell), no welcome for them! Verily, they shall enter in the Fire!
38|60|(The followers will say to those who misled): "Nay, you (too)! No welcome for you! It is you who brought this upon us, so evil is this place to stay in!"
38|61|They will say: "Our Lord! Whoever brought this upon us, add to him a double torment in the Fire!"
38|62|And they will say: "What is the matter with us that we see not men whom we used to count among the bad ones"
38|63|"Did we take them as an object of mockery, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them"
38|64|Verily, that is the very truth -- the mutual dispute of the people of the Fire!
38|65|Say: "I am only a warner and there is no God (worthy of worship) except Allah the One, the Irresistible,"
38|66|"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving."
38|67|Say: "That is a great news,"
38|68|"From which you turn away!"
38|69|"I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing."
38|70|"Only this has been revealed to me, that I am a plain warner."
38|71|(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "Truly, I am going to create man from clay."
38|72|"So, when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him."
38|73|So, the angels prostrated themselves, all of them,
38|74|Except Iblis, he was proud and was one of the disbelievers.
38|75|(Allah) said: "O Iblis! What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands. Are you too proud or are you one of the high exalted"
38|76|[Iblis] said: "I am better than he. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay."
38|77|(Allah) said: "Then get out from here; for verily, you are outcast."
38|78|"And verily, My curse is on you till the Day of Recompense."
38|79|[Iblis] said: "My Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are resurrected."
38|80|(Allah) said: "Verily, you are of those allowed respite,"
38|81|"Till the Day of the time appointed."
38|82|[Iblis] said: "By Your might, then I will surely mislead them all,"
38|83|"Except Your true servants amongst them."
38|84|(Allah) said: "The truth is -- the truth I say - "
38|85|"That I will fill Hell with you and those of them (mankind) that follow you, together."
38|86|Say: "No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the Mutakallifin."
38|87|"It is only a Reminder for all the creatures."
38|88|"And you shall certainly know the truth of it after a while."
