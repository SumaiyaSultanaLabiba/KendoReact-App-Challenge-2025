# Surah Ha-Mim
Surah: Ha-Mim | Chapter: 41

41|1|Ha Mim.
41|2|A revelation from the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
41|3|A Book whereof the Ayat are explained in detail -- a Qur'an in Arabic for people who know.
41|4|Giving glad tidings and warning, but most of them turn away, so they hear not.
41|5|And they say: "Our hearts are under coverings from that to which you invite us; and in our ears is deafness, and between us and you is a screen, so work you (on your way); verily, we are working (on our way)."
41|6|Say: "I am only a human being like you. It is revealed to me that your God is One God, therefore take straight path to Him and obedience to Him, and seek forgiveness of Him. And woe to the polytheists.
41|7|Those who give not the Zakah and they are disbelievers in the Hereafter.
41|8|Truly, those who believe and do righteous good deeds, for them will be an endless reward that will never stop.
41|9|Say: "Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days And you set up rivals with Him That is the Lord of all that exists."
41|10|He placed therein firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance in four Days equal for all those who ask.
41|11|Then He rose over (Istawa ila) the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: "Come both of you willingly or unwillingly." They both said: "We come willingly."
41|12|Then He completed and finished their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard. Such is the decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower.
41|13|But if they turn away, then say: "I have warned you of a Sa`iqah like the Sa`iqah which overtook `Ad and Thamud."
41|14|When the Messengers came to them, from before them and behind them (saying): "Worship none but Allah," they said: "If our Lord had so willed, He would surely have sent down the angels. So, indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent."
41|15|As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: "Who is mightier than us in strength" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat!
41|16|So, We sent upon them a Sarsar wind in days of calamity that We might give them a taste of disgracing torment in this present worldly life. But surely the torment of the Hereafter will be more disgracing, and they will never be helped.
41|17|And as for Thamud, We showed them the path of truth but they preferred blindness to guidance; so the Sa`iqah of disgracing torment seized them because of what they used to earn.
41|18|And We saved those who believed and had Taqwa.
41|19|And (remember) the Day that the enemies of Allah will be gathered to the Fire, then they will be driven.
41|20|Till, when they reach it, their hearing (ears) and their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do.
41|21|And they will say to their skins, "Why do you testify against us" They will say: "Allah has caused us to speak - as He causes all things to speak, and He created you the first time, and to Him you are made to return."
41|22|And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you; but you thought that Allah knew not much of what you were doing.
41|23|And that thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to destruction; and you have become of those utterly lost!
41|24|Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah.
41|25|And We have assigned for them intimate companions (in this world), who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them. And the Word is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of Jinn and men that had passed away before them. Indeed they (all) were the losers.
41|26|And those who disbelieve say: "Listen not to this Qur'an, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome."
41|27|But surely, We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe torment, and certainly, We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do.
41|28|That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah: the Fire. Therein will be for them the eternal home, a recompense for that they used to deny Our Ayat.
41|29|And those who disbelieve will say: "Our Lord! Show us those among Jinn and men who led us astray, that we may crush them under our feet so that they become the lowest."
41|30|Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is Allah," and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (saying): "Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!"
41|31|"We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask."
41|32|"An entertainment from the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
41|33|And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah, and does righteous deeds, and says: "I am one of the Muslims."
41|34|The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.
41|35|But none is granted it except those who are patient -- and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion in this world.
41|36|And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away, then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.
41|37|And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate yourselves to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you worship Him.
41|38|But if they are too proud, then there are those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired.
41|39|And among His signs; that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water to it, it is stirred to life and growth. Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is Able to do all things.
41|40|Verily, those who Yulhiduna Fi Our Ayat are not hidden from Us. Is he who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection Do what you will. Verily, He is All-Seer of what you do.
41|41|Verily, those who disbelieved in the Reminder when it came to them. And verily, it is an honorable well-fortified respected Book.
41|42|Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.
41|43|Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you. Verily, your Lord is the Possessor of forgiveness, and (also) the Possessor of painful punishment.
41|44|And if We had sent this as a Qur'an in a foreign language, they would have said: "Why are not its verses explained in detail What! Not in Arabic nor an Arab" Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a cure. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness in their ears, and it is blindness for them. They are called from a place far away."
41|45|And indeed We gave Musa the Scripture, but dispute arose therein. And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, and the matter would have been settled between them. But truly, they are in grave doubt thereto.
41|46|Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for himself; and whosoever does evil, it is against himself. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.
41|47|To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive nor brings forth (young), except by His knowledge. And on the Day when He will call unto them (saying): "Where are My (so-called) partners" They will say: "We inform You that none of us bears witness to it!"
41|48|And those whom they used to invoke before (in this world) shall disappear from them, and they will perceive that they have no place of refuge.
41|49|Man does not get tired of asking for good; but if an evil touches him, then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair.
41|50|And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: "This is due to my (merit); I think not that the Hour will be established. But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him. "Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.
41|51|And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant; but when evil touches him, then he has recourse to long supplications.
41|52|Say: "Tell me, if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it Who is more astray than one who is in opposition far away."
41|53|We will show them Our signs in the universes, and within themselves, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the truth. Is it not sufficient in regard to your Lord that He is a Witness over all things
41|54|Lo, Verily, they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord. Verily, He is surrounding all things!
