# Surah Ad-Dukhan
Surah: Ad-Dukhan | Chapter: 44

44|1|Ha Mim.
44|2|By the manifest Book that makes things clear.
44|3|We sent it down on a blessed night. Verily, We are ever warning.
44|4|Therein (that night) is decreed every matter, Hakim.
44|5|As a command from Us. Verily, We are ever sending,
44|6|(As) a mercy from your Lord. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.
44|7|The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if you (but) have a faith with certainty.
44|8|La ilaha illa Huwa. He gives life and causes death -- your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.
44|9|Nay! They play about in doubt.
44|10|Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke,
44|11|Covering mankind, this is a painful torment.
44|12|(They will say): "Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!"
44|13|How can there be for them an admonition, when a Messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them.
44|14|Then they had turned away from him and said: "(He is) one taught, a madman!"
44|15|Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.
44|16|On the Day when We shall strike you with the great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.
44|17|And indeed We tried before them Fir`awn's people, when there came to them a noble Messenger.
44|18|Saying: "Deliver to me the servants of Allah. Verily, I am to you a Messenger worthy of all trust."
44|19|"And exalt not yourselves against Allah. Truly, I have come to you with a manifest authority."
44|20|"And truly, I seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord, lest you should stone me."
44|21|"But if you believe me not, then keep away from me and leave me alone."
44|22|So he (Musa) called upon his Lord (saying): "These are indeed the people who are criminals."
44|23|(Allah said): "Depart you with My servants by night. Surely, you will be pursued."
44|24|"And leave the sea as it is (quiet and divided). Verily, they are a host to be drowned."
44|25|How many of gardens and springs that they (Fir`awn's people) left behind,
44|26|And green crops (fields) and goodly places,
44|27|And comforts of life wherein they used to take delight!
44|28|Thus (it was)! And We made other people inherit them.
44|29|And the heavens and the earth wept not for them, nor were they given respite.
44|30|And indeed We saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment,
44|31|From Fir`awn; verily, he was arrogant and was of the excessive.
44|32|And We chose them above the nations (Al-`Alamin) with knowledge,
44|33|And granted them signs in which there was a plain trial.
44|34|Verily, these people are saying:
44|35|"There is nothing but our first death, and we shall not be resurrected."
44|36|"Then bring back our forefathers, if you speak the truth!"
44|37|Are they better or the people of Tubba` and those before them We destroyed them because they were indeed criminals.
44|38|And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, for mere play.
44|39|We created them not except with truth, but most of them know not.
44|40|Verily, the Day of Judgement is the time appointed for all of them --
44|41|The Day when a near relative cannot avail a near relative in aught, and no help can they receive,
44|42|Except him on whom Allah has mercy. Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
44|43|Verily, the tree of Zaqqum
44|44|Will be the food of the sinners.
44|45|Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies,
44|46|Like the boiling of scalding water.
44|47|(It will be said:) "Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire,"
44|48|"Then pour over his head the torment of boiling water."
44|49|"Taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous."
44|50|"Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!"
44|51|Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in place of security.
44|52|Among Gardens and Springs,
44|53|Dressed in Sundus and Istabraq, facing each other,
44|54|So (it will be). And We shall marry them to Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes,
44|55|They will call therein for every kind of fruit in peace and security;
44|56|They will never taste death therein except the first death, and He will save them from the torment of the blazing Fire,
44|57|As a bounty from your Lord! That will be the supreme success!
44|58|Certainly, We have made this easy in your tongue, in order that they may remember.
44|59|Wait then; verily, they (too) are waiting.
