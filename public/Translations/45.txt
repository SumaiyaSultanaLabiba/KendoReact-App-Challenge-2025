# Surah Al-Jathiyah
Surah: Al-Jathiyah | Chapter: 45

45|1|Ha Mim.
45|2|The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise.
45|3|Verily, in the heavens and the earth are signs for the believers.
45|4|And in your creation, and what He spread (through the earth) of moving creatures are signs for people who have faith with certainty.
45|5|And in the alternation of night and day, and the provision that Allah sends down from the sky, and revives therewith the earth after its death, and in the turning about of the winds, are signs for a people who understand.
45|6|These are the Ayat of Allah, which We recite to you with truth. Then in which speech after Allah and His Ayat will they believe
45|7|Woe to every sinful liar.
45|8|Who hears the Ayat of Allah Tutla (recited) to him, yet persists with pride as if he heard them not. So announce to him a painful torment!
45|9|And when he learns something of Our Ayat, he makes them a jest. For such there will be a humiliating torment.
45|10|In front of them there is Hell. And that which they have earned will be of no profit to them, nor those whom they have taken as protective friends besides Allah. And theirs will be a great torment.
45|11|This is guidance. And those who disbelieve in the Ayat of their Lord, for them there is a painful torment of Rijz.
45|12|Allah, it is He Who has subjected to you the sea, that ships may sail through it by His command, and that you may seek of His bounty, and that you may be thankful.
45|13|And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth; it is all (as a favor and kindness) from Him. Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.
45|14|Say to the believers to forgive those who hope not for the Days of Allah, that He may recompense people, according to what they have earned.
45|15|Whosoever does a good deed, it is for himself, and whosoever does evil, it is against (himself). Then to your Lord you will be made to return.
45|16|And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the prophethood; and provided them with good things, and preferred them above the nations.
45|17|And gave them clear proofs in matters. And they differed not until after the knowledge came to them, through envy among themselves. Verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ.
45|18|Then We have put you on a (legal) way of commandment. So follow you that, and follow not the desires of those who know not.
45|19|Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah. Verily, the wrongdoers are protecting friends of one another, but Allah is the Protector of those who have Taqwa.
45|20|This is a clear insight and evidence for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy for people who have faith with certainty.
45|21|Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their present life and after their death Worst is the judgement that they make.
45|22|And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth, in order that each person may be recompensed what he has earned, and they will not be wronged.
45|23|Have you seen him who takes his own lust as his god And Allah, left him astray with knowledge, and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who then will guide him after Allah Will you not then remember
45|24|And they say: "There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (time). And they have no knowledge of it, they only presume.
45|25|And when Our Clear Ayat are recited to them, their argument is no other than that they say: "Bring back our (dead) fathers, if you are truthful!"
45|26|Say (to them): "Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But most of mankind know not."
45|27|And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And on the Day that the Hour will be established -- on that Day the followers of falsehood shall lose.
45|28|And you will see each nation humbled to their knees (Jathiyah), each nation will be called to its Record (of deeds). This Day you shall be recompensed for what you used to do.
45|29|This Our Record speaks about you with truth. Verily, We were recording what you used to do.
45|30|Then, as for those who believed and did good deeds, their Lord will admit them to His mercy. That will be the evident success.
45|31|But as for those who disbelieved (it will be said to them): "Were not Our Ayat recited to you But you were proud, and you were a people who were criminals."
45|32|And when it was said: "Verily, Allah's promise is the truth, and there is no doubt about the coming of the Hour," you said: "We know not what is the Hour: we do not think it but conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief (therein)."
45|33|And the evil of what they did will appear to them, and that which they used to mock at will completely encircle them.
45|34|And it will be said: "This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours. And your abode is the Fire, and there is none to help you."
45|35|This, because you took the revelations of Allah in mockery, and the life of the world deceived you. So this Day, they shall not be taken out from there (Hell), nor shall they be returned to the worldly life.
45|36|So all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, and the Lord of all that exists.
45|37|And His is the majesty in the heavens and the earth, and He is Al-`Aziz, Al-Hakim.
