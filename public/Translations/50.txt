# Surah Qaf
Surah: Qaf | Chapter: 50

50|1|Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an.
50|2|Nay, they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. So the disbelievers say: "This is a strange thing!"
50|3|"When we are dead and have become dust. (Shall we be resurrected) That is a far return."
50|4|We know that which the earth takes of them, and with Us is a Book preserved.
50|5|Nay, but they have denied the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a Marij state.
50|6|Have they not looked at the heaven above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no Furuj in it
50|7|And the earth! We have spread it out, and set thereon Rawasi standing firm, and We planted in it every lovely (Bahij) pair.
50|8|An insight and a Reminder for every servant who turns to Allah in repentance.
50|9|And We send down blessed water (rain) from the sky, then We produce therewith Jannat and grain that are reaped.
50|10|And date palms Basiqat, with arranged clusters.
50|11|A provision for the servants. And We give life therewith to a dead land. Thus will be the Resurrection.
50|12|Denied before them the people of Nuh, and the Dwellers of Rass, and Thamud,
50|13|And `Ad, and Fir`awn, and the brethren of Lut,
50|14|And the Dwellers of Al-Aykah, and the people of Tubba`. Everyone of them denied (their) Messengers, so My threat took effect.
50|15|Were We then tired with the first creation Nay, they are in confused doubt about a new creation.
50|16|And indeed We have created man, and We know what his self whispers to him. And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.
50|17|(Remember) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being), one sitting on the right and one on the left.
50|18|Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).
50|19|And the stupor of death will come in truth: "This is what you have been avoiding!"
50|20|And the Trumpet will be blown -- that will be the Day of the threat.
50|21|And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.
50|22|(It will be said to the sinners): "Indeed you were heedless of this. Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!"
50|23|And his companion (angel) will say: "Here is (his record) ready with me!"
50|24|(Allah will say to the angels:) "Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever"
50|25|"Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter,"
50|26|"Who set up another god with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment."
50|27|His companion (devil) will say: "Our Lord! I did not push him to transgression, but he was himself in error far astray."
50|28|(Allah) will say: "Dispute not in front of Me, I had already in advance sent you the threat."
50|29|"The sentence that comes from Me cannot be changed, and I am not unjust to the servants."
50|30|On the Day when We will say to Hell: "Are you filled" It will say: "Are there any more"
50|31|And Paradise will be Uzlifat to those who had Taqwa, not far off.
50|32|(It will be said): "This is what you were promised -- (it is) for those returning in sincere repentance, and Hafiz."
50|33|"Who feared Ar-Rahman unseen and brought a heart turned in repentance."
50|34|"Enter you therein in peace and security -- this is a Day of eternal life!"
50|35|There they will have all that they desire -- and We have more.
50|36|And how many a generation We have destroyed before them who were stronger in power than they. And they went about the land! Could they find any place of refuge
50|37|Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful.
50|38|And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched Us.
50|39|So bear with patience all that they say, and glorify the praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting.
50|40|And during a part of the night (also) glorify His praises and (so likewise) after the prostrations.
50|41|And listen on the Day when the caller will call from a near place.
50|42|The Day when they will hear As-Sayhah in truth, that will be the Day of coming out.
50|43|Verily, it is We Who give life and cause death; and to Us is the final return.
50|44|On the Day when the earth shall be cleft, from off them (they will come out) hastening forth. That will be a gathering, quite easy for Us.
50|45|We know best what they say. And you are not the one to force them. But warn by the Qur'an; him who fears My threat.
