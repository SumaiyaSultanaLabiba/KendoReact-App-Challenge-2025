# Surah Ad-Dhariyat
Surah: Ad-Dhariyat | Chapter: 51

51|1|By the scattering Dhariyat;
51|2|And the laden Hamilat;
51|3|And the steady Jariyat;
51|4|And the distributors of command,
51|5|Verily, that which you are promised is surely true.
51|6|And verily, Ad-Din is sure to occur.
51|7|By the heaven full of Hubuk,
51|8|Certainly, you have different ideas.
51|9|Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside.
51|10|Cursed be Al-Kharrasun
51|11|Who are under a cover of Sahun,
51|12|They ask: "When will be the Day of Ad-Din"
51|13|(It will be) a Day when they will be Yuftanun in the Fire!
51|14|"Taste you your trial! This is what you used to ask to be hastened!"
51|15|Verily, those who have Taqwa will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs,
51|16|Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily, they were before this doers of good.
51|17|They used to sleep but little by night.
51|18|And in the hours before dawn, they were asking for forgiveness.
51|19|And in their wealth there was the right of the Sa'il and the Mahrum.
51|20|And on the earth are signs for those who have faith with certainty.
51|21|And also in yourselves. Will you not then see
51|22|And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.
51|23|Then by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it is the truth, just as you can speak.
51|24|Has the story reached you, of the honored guests of Ibrahim
51|25|When they came in to him and said: "Salaman!" He answered: "Salamun" and said: "You are a people unknown to me."
51|26|Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf.
51|27|And placed it before them (saying): "Will you not eat"
51|28|Then he conceived fear of them (when they ate not). They said: "Fear not." And they gave him glad tidings of a son having knowledge.
51|29|Then his wife came forward with a loud voice; she smote her face, and said: "A barren old woman!"
51|30|They said: "Even so says your Lord. Verily, He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower."
51|31|(Ibrahim) said: "Then for what purpose you have come, O messengers"
51|32|They said: "We have been sent to a people who are criminals."
51|33|"To send down upon them stones of clay."
51|34|"Marked by your Lord for transgressors."
51|35|So We brought out from therein the believers.
51|36|But We found not there any household of the Muslims except one.
51|37|And We have left there a sign for those who fear the painful torment.
51|38|And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority.
51|39|But (he) turned away along with his hosts, and said: "A sorcerer or a madman."
51|40|So We took him and his armies, and dumped them into the sea (Yamm), for he was blameworthy.
51|41|And in `Ad when We sent against them the barren wind;
51|42|It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.
51|43|And in Thamud, when they were told: "Enjoy yourselves for a while!"
51|44|But they insolently defied the command of their Lord, so the Sa`iqah overtook them while they were looking.
51|45|Then they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves.
51|46|(So were) the people of Nuh before them. Verily, they were a people who were rebellious.
51|47|With Hands We constructed the heaven. Verily, We are able to expand the vastness of space thereof.
51|48|And We have made the earth a Firash; how excellent spreader (thereof) are We!
51|49|And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember.
51|50|So, flee to Allah. Verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him.
51|51|And set not up any other god along with Allah. Verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him.
51|52|Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: "A sorcerer or a madman!"
51|53|Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!
51|54|So turn away from them, you are not blameworthy.
51|55|And remind, for verily, the reminding profits the believers.
51|56|And I created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me.
51|57|I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me.
51|58|Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of power, the Most Strong.
51|59|And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a portion of torment like to the evil portion of torment (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on!
51|60|Then woe to those who disbelieve from their Day which they have been promised.
