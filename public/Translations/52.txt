# Surah At-Tur
Surah: At-Tur | Chapter: 52

52|1|By the Tur
52|2|And the Book inscribed
52|3|In parchment unrolled.
52|4|And by Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.
52|5|And the roof raised high.
52|6|And by the sea that is Masjur.
52|7|Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.
52|8|There is none that can avert it.
52|9|On the Day when Tamur the heaven Mawr,
52|10|And Tasir the mountains Sayr.
52|11|Then woe that Day to those who denied.
52|12|Those who were, in their falsehood, playing.
52|13|The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.
52|14|This is the Fire which you used to deny.
52|15|Is this magic or do you not see
52|16|Enter therein and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same. You are only being requited for what you used to do.
52|17|Verily, those who have Taqwa will be in Gardens and Delight.
52|18|Enjoying in that which their Lord has bestowed on them, and (the fact that) their Lord saved them from the torment of the blazing Fire.
52|19|"Eat and drink with happiness because of what you used to do."
52|20|They will recline on thrones Masfufah. And We shall marry them to Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes.
52|21|And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.
52|22|And We shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.
52|23|There they shall pass from hand to hand a cup, free from any idle talk, and free from sin.
52|24|And there will go round boy-servants of theirs, to serve them as if they were preserved pearls.
52|25|And some of them draw near to others, questioning.
52|26|Saying: "Aforetime, we were afraid in the midst of our families."
52|27|"So Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire."
52|28|"Verily, We used to invoke Him before. Verily, He is the Most Subtle, the Most Merciful."
52|29|Therefore, remind. By the grace of Allah, you are neither a Kahin nor a madman.
52|30|Or do they say: "A poet! We await for him some calamity by time!"
52|31|Say: "Wait! I am with you among those who wait!"
52|32|Or do their minds command them this or are they people transgressing all bounds
52|33|Or do they say: "He has forged it" Nay! They believe not!
52|34|Let them then produce a recitation like unto it if they are truthful.
52|35|Or were they created by nothing Or were they themselves the creators
52|36|Or did they create the heavens and the earth Nay, but they have no firm belief.
52|37|Or are with them the treasures of your Lord Or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like
52|38|Or have they a stairway (to heaven), by means of which they listen Then let their listener produce some manifest proof.
52|39|Or has He only daughters and you have sons
52|40|Or is it that you ask a wage from them so that they are burdened with a load of debt
52|41|Or that the Unseen is with them, and they write it down
52|42|Or do they intend a plot But those who disbelieve are themselves plotted against!
52|43|Or have they a god other than Allah Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partners.
52|44|And if they were to see a piece of the heaven falling down, they would say: "Clouds gathered in heaps!"
52|45|So leave them alone till they meet their Day, in which they will sink into a fainting (with horror).
52|46|The Day when their plotting shall not avail them at all, nor will they be helped.
52|47|And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment before this; but most of them know not.
52|48|So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes; and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.
52|49|And in the nighttime also glorify His praises and at the setting of the stars.
