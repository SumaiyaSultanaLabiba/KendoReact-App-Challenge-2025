# Surah An-Najm
Surah: An-Najm | Chapter: 53

53|1|By the star when it goes down.
53|2|Your companion has neither gone astray nor has he erred.
53|3|Nor does he speak of desire.
53|4|It is only a revelation revealed.
53|5|He has been taught by one mighty in power.
53|6|Dhu Mirrah then he Istawa.
53|7|While he was in the highest part of the horizon,
53|8|Then he approached and came closer,
53|9|And was at a distance of two bows' length or less.
53|10|So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.
53|11|The heart lied not in what he saw.
53|12|Will you then dispute with him about what he saw
53|13|And indeed he saw him at a second descent.
53|14|Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.
53|15|Near it is the Paradise of Abode.
53|16|When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!
53|17|The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.
53|18|Indeed he saw of the greatest Ssgns of his Lord.
53|19|Have you then considered Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.
53|20|And Manat, the other third
53|21|Is it for you the males and for Him the females
53|22|That indeed is a division most unfair!
53|23|They are but names which you have named - you and your fathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire, whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord!
53|24|Or shall man have what he wishes
53|25|But to Allah belongs the last (Hereafter) and the first (the world).
53|26|And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing, except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.
53|27|Verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names.
53|28|But they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but conjecture, and verily, conjecture is no substitute for the truth.
53|29|Therefore withdraw from him who turns away from Our Reminder and desires nothing but the life of this world.
53|30|That is what they could reach of knowledge. Verily, your Lord is He, Who knows best him who goes astray from His path, and He knows best him who receives guidance.
53|31|And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best.
53|32|Those who avoid great sins and Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) except Al-Lamam -- verily, your Lord is of vast forgiveness. He knows you well when He created you from the earth (Adam), and when you were fetuses in your mothers' wombs. So, ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows best him who has Taqwa.
53|33|Did you observe him who turned away (from Islam).
53|34|And gave a little, then stopped
53|35|Is with him the knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees
53|36|Or is he not informed with what is in the Suhuf of Musa,
53|37|And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that:
53|38|That no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another.
53|39|And that man can have nothing but what he does.
53|40|And that his deeds will be seen.
53|41|Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense.
53|42|And that to your Lord is the End.
53|43|And that it is He Who makes laugh, and makes weep.
53|44|And that it is He Who causes death and gives life.
53|45|And that He creates the pairs, male and female,
53|46|From Nutfah when it is emitted.
53|47|And that upon Him is another bringing forth (Resurrection).
53|48|And that it is He Who Aghna and Aqna.
53|49|And that He is the Lord of Ash-Shi`ra.
53|50|And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad,
53|51|And Thamud. He spared none of them.
53|52|And the people of Nuh aforetime. Verily, they were more unjust and more rebellious and transgressing.
53|53|And He destroyed the overthrown cities.
53|54|So, there covered them that which did cover.
53|55|Then which of the graces of your Lord will you doubt
53|56|This is a warner from the warners of old.
53|57|The Azifah draws near.
53|58|None besides Allah can avert it.
53|59|Do you then wonder at this reci- tation
53|60|And you laugh at it and weep not,
53|61|While you are Samidun.
53|62|So fall you down in prostration to Allah and worship Him.
