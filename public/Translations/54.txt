# Surah Al-Qamar
Surah: Al-Qamar | Chapter: 54

54|1|The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.
54|2|And if they see an Ayah, they turn away and say: "This is magic, Mustamir."
54|3|They denied and followed their own lusts. And every matter will be settled.
54|4|And indeed there has come to them news wherein there is Muzdajar.
54|5|Perfect wisdom, but warners benefit them not.
54|6|So withdraw from them. The Day that the caller will call (them) to a terrible thing.
54|7|They will come forth, with humbled eyes from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread abroad,
54|8|Hastening towards the caller. The disbelievers will say: "This is a hard Day."
54|9|The people of Nuh denied (their Messenger) before them. They rejected Our servant and said: "A madman!" Wazdujir.
54|10|Then he invoked his Lord (saying): "I have been overcome, so help (me)!"
54|11|So, We opened the gates of the heaven with water Munhamir.
54|12|And We caused springs to gush forth from the earth. So, the waters met for a matter predestined.
54|13|And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails (Dusur)
54|14|Floating under Our Eyes, a reward for him who had been rejected!
54|15|And indeed, We have left this as a sign. Then is there any that will remember
54|16|Then how (terrible) was My torment and My warnings
54|17|And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there anyone who will remember
54|18|`Ad denied; then how was My torment and My warnings
54|19|Verily, We sent against them a violently cold (Sarsar) wind on a day of calamity, continuous.
54|20|Plucking out men as if they were uprooted stems of date palms.
54|21|Then, how was My torment and My warnings
54|22|And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember
54|23|Thamud denied the warnings.
54|24|And they said: "A man, alone among us -- shall we follow him Truly, then we should be in error and distress!"
54|25|"Is it that the Reminder is sent to him alone from among us Nay, he is an insolent liar!"
54|26|Tomorrow they will come to know who is the liar, the insolent one!
54|27|Verily, We are sending the she-camel as a test for them. So watch them, and be patient!
54|28|And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them, each one's right to drink being established (by turns).
54|29|But they called their comrade and he took (a sword) and killed (her).
54|30|Then, how was My torment and My warnings
54|31|Verily, We sent against them a single Sayhah, and they became like straw Al-Muhtazir.
54|32|And indeed, We have made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember
54|33|The people of Lut denied the warnings.
54|34|Verily, We sent against them Hasib (a violent storm of stones), except the family of Lut, them We saved in the last hour of the night,
54|35|As a favor from Us. Thus do We reward him who gives thanks.
54|36|And he indeed had warned them of Our punishment, but they doubted the warnings!
54|37|And they indeed sought to shame his guests. So, We blinded their eyes (saying), "Then taste you My torment and My warnings."
54|38|And verily, an abiding torment seized them early in the morning.
54|39|Then taste you My torment and My warnings.
54|40|And indeed, We have made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember
54|41|And indeed, warnings came to the people of Fir`awn.
54|42|(They) denied all Our signs, so We seized them with a punishment of the Almighty, All-Capable.
54|43|Are your disbelievers better than these Or have you immunity in the Divine Scriptures
54|44|Or say they: "We are a great multitude, victorious"
54|45|Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.
54|46|Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time, and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.
54|47|Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn.
54|48|The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire (it will be said to them): "Taste you the touch of Hell!"
54|49|Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.
54|50|And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.
54|51|And indeed, We have destroyed your likes; then is there any that will remember
54|52|And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.
54|53|And everything, small and large, is written down.
54|54|Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.
54|55|In a seat of truth, near the Muqtadir King.
