# Surah Al-Waqiah
Surah: Al-Waqiah | Chapter: 56

56|1|When the Waqi`ah occurs
56|2|There is not, for its occurrence, Kadhibah.
56|3|Bringing low (some), exalting (others).
56|4|When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.
56|5|And the mountains will be powdered to dust,
56|6|So that they will become floating dust particles.
56|7|And you (all) will be in three groups.
56|8|So those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right!
56|9|And those on the left -- how (unfortunate) will be those on the left!
56|10|And those foremost will be foremost.
56|11|These will be the nearest (to Allah).
56|12|In the Gardens of Delight.
56|13|A multitude of those will be from the first ones.
56|14|And a few of those will be from the later ones.
56|15|(They will be) on thrones, Mawdunah.
56|16|Reclining thereon, face to face.
56|17|Immortal boys will go around them (serving),
56|18|With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine,
56|19|Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.
56|20|And with fruit that they may choose.
56|21|And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.
56|22|And (there will be) Hur with wide lovely eyes.
56|23|Like preserved pearls.
56|24|A reward for what they used to do.
56|25|No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech.
56|26|But only the saying of: "Salaman! Salaman!"
56|27|And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right
56|28|(They will be) among Sidri Makhdud,
56|29|And among Talh Mandud.
56|30|And in shade Mamdud,
56|31|And by water flowing constantly,
56|32|And fruit in plenty,
56|33|Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.
56|34|And on couches, raised high.
56|35|Verily, We have created them a special creation.
56|36|And made them virgins.
56|37|`Urub, Atrab.
56|38|For those on the right.
56|39|A multitude of those will be from the first generation.
56|40|And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.
56|41|And those on the left How will be those on the left
56|42|In Samum, and Hamim.
56|43|And a shadow from Yahmum,
56|44|Neither Barid nor Karim,
56|45|Verily, before that, they indulged in luxury,
56|46|And were persisting in great sin.
56|47|And they used to say: "When we die and become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be resurrected"
56|48|"And also our forefathers"
56|49|Say: "(Yes) verily, those of old, and those of later times."
56|50|"All will surely be gathered together for appointed meeting of a known Day."
56|51|"Then verily, --- you the erring -- ones, the deniers!"
56|52|"You verily, will eat of the trees of Zaqqum."
56|53|"Then you will fill your bellies therewith,"
56|54|"And drink the Hamim on top of it."
56|55|"And you will drink (that) like Al-Him!"
56|56|That will be their entertainment on the Day of Recompense!
56|57|We created you, then why do you believe not
56|58|Do you not see the semen you emit.
56|59|Is it you who create it, or are We the Creator
56|60|We have decreed death to you all, and We are not outstripped,
56|61|To transfigure you and create you in (forms) that you know not.
56|62|And indeed, you have already known the first form of creation, why then do you not remember
56|63|Do you not see what you sow.
56|64|Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower
56|65|Were it Our will, We could crumble it to dry pieces, and you would be Tafakkahun.
56|66|(Saying:) "We are indeed Mughramun!"
56|67|"Nay, but we are deprived!"
56|68|Do you not see the water that you drink.
56|69|Is it you who cause it to come down from Al-Muzn, or are We the Cause of it coming down
56|70|If We willed, We verily could make it salty; why then do you not give thanks
56|71|Do you not see the fire which you kindle.
56|72|Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower
56|73|We have made it a Reminder, and an article of use for the Muqwin.
56|74|Then glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
56|75|Fala! I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars.
56|76|And verily that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.
56|77|That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.
56|78|In a Book Maknun.
56|79|Which none touches but the pure ones.
56|80|A revelation from the Lord of all that exists.
56|81|Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun
56|82|And you make your provision your denial!
56|83|Then why do you not (intervene) when it reaches Al-Hulqum
56|84|And you at the moment are looking,
56|85|But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not,
56|86|Then why do you not -- if you are not Madinin
56|87|Return the soul, if you are truthful
56|88|Then, if he be of the Muqarrabin,
56|89|Then Rawh, Rayhan and a Garden of Delights.
56|90|And if he be of those on the right,
56|91|Then Salam (peace) to you from those on the right.
56|92|But if he be of the denying, the erring,
56|93|Then for him is an entertainment with Hamim.
56|94|And entry in Hellfire.
56|95|Verily, this! This is an absolute truth with certainty.
56|96|So, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
