# Surah As-Saff
Surah: As-Saff | Chapter: 61

61|1|Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.
61|2|O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do
61|3|Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do.
61|4|Verily, Allah loves those who fight in His cause in rows as if they were a solid structure.
61|5|And when Musa said to his people: "O my people! Why do you annoy me while you know certainly that I am the Messenger of Allah to you So, when they turned away (from the path of Allah), Allah turned their hearts away (from the right path). And Allah guides not the people who are rebellious.
61|6|And (remember) when `Isa, son of Maryam, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrah [which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad. "But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said: "This is plain magic."
61|7|And who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah, while he is being invited to Islam And Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.
61|8|They intend to put out the Light of Allah with their mouths. But Allah will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it).
61|9|He it is Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it victorious over all religions even though idolators hate (it).
61|10|O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment
61|11|That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know!
61|12|(If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in `Adn (Eternal) Paradise; that is indeed the great success.
61|13|And also (He will give you) another (blessing) which you love, help from Allah and a near victory. And give glad tidings to the believers.
61|14|O you who believe! Be you helpers (in the cause) of Allah as said `Isa, son of Maryam, to the Hawariyyin (the disciples): "Who are my helpers (in the cause) of Allah" The Hawariyyun said: "We are Allah's helpers" (i.e., we will strive in His cause!). Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved. So, We gave power to those who believed against their enemies, and they became the victorious (uppermost).
