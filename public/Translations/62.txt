# Surah Al-Jumuah
Surah: Al-Jumuah | Chapter: 62

62|1|Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah -- the King, the Holy, the Almighty, the All-Wise.
62|2|He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Ayat, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and the Hikmah. And verily, they had been before in manifest error.
62|3|And others among them who have not yet joined them. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.
62|4|That is the grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is the Owner of mighty grace.
62|5|The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Tawrah, but did not carry it, is as the likeness of a donkey which carries huge burdens of books. How bad is the example of people who deny the Ayat of Allah. And Allah does not guide the people who are wrongdoers.
62|6|Say: "O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other people, then long for death if you are truthful."
62|7|But they will never long for it, because of what their hands have sent before them! And Allah knows well the wrongdoers.
62|8|Say: "Verily, the death from which you flee, will surely meet you, then you will be sent back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you about what you used to do."
62|9|O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Al-Jumu`ah (Friday), then hasten (Fas`aw) to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business. That is better for you if you did but know!
62|10|Then when the Salah is complete, you may disperse through the land, and seek the bounty of Allah, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful.
62|11|And when they see some merchandise or some amusement, they disperse headlong to it, and leave you standing. Say: "That which Allah has is better than any amusement or merchandise! And Allah is the best of providers."
