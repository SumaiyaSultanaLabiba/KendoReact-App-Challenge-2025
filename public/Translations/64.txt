# Surah At-Taghabun
Surah: At-Taghabun | Chapter: 64

64|1|Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. His is the dominion, and to Him belongs the praise, and He is Able to do all things.
64|2|He it is Who created you, then some of you are disbelievers and some of you are believers. And Allah is All-Seer of what you do.
64|3|He has created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He shaped you and made good your shapes. And to Him is the return.
64|4|He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. And Allah is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts.
64|5|Has not the news reached you of those who disbelieved aforetime And so they tasted the evil result of their disbelief, and theirs will be a painful torment.
64|6|That was because there came to them their Messengers with Bayyinat, but they said: "Shall mere men guide us" So they disbelieved and turned away. But Allah was not in need. And Allah is not in need, Worthy of all praise.
64|7|The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected. Say: "Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of what you did; and that is easy for Allah."
64|8|Therefore, believe in Allah and His Messenger and in the Light which We have sent down. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
64|9|The Day when He will gather you on the Day of Gathering, that will be the Day of At-Taghabun. And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous deeds, He will expiate from him his sins, and will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever; that will be the great success.
64|10|But those who disbelieved and denied Our Ayat, they will be the dwellers of the Fire, to dwell therein forever. And worst indeed is that destination
64|11|No calamity occurs, but by the permission of Allah, and whosoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart. And Allah is the All-Knower of everything.
64|12|Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away, then the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey clearly.
64|13|Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa. And in Allah therefore let the believers put their trust.
64|14|O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you; therefore beware of them! But if you pardon (them) and overlook, and forgive, then verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
64|15|Your wealth and your children are only a Fitnah, whereas Allah! With Him is a great reward.
64|16|So have Taqwa of Allah as much as you can; listen and obey, and spend in charity; that is better for yourselves. And whosoever is saved from his own greed, then they are the successful ones.
64|17|If you lend to Allah a handsome loan, He will double it for you, and will forgive you. And Allah is Shakur, Halim,
64|18|All-Knower of the unseen and seen, the Almighty, the All-Wise.
