# Surah Al-Mulk
Surah: Al-Mulk | Chapter: 67

67|1|Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion; and He is Able to do all things.
67|2|Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving;
67|3|Who has created the seven heavens one above the other; you can see no fault in the creation of the Most Gracious. Then look again. Can you see any rifts
67|4|Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you Khasi', and worn out.
67|5|And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin, and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.
67|6|And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the torment of Hell, and worst indeed is that destination.
67|7|When they are cast therein, they will hear its Shahiq while it is simmering.
67|8|It almost bursts up with fury. Every time a group is cast therein, its keepers will ask: "Did no warner come to you"
67|9|They will say: "Yes, indeed a warner did come to us, but we rejected him and said: `Allah never sent down anything; you are only in great error."'
67|10|And they will say: "Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!"
67|11|Then they will confess their sin. So, away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire!
67|12|Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.
67|13|And whether you keep your talk secret or disclose it, verily, He is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts.
67|14|Should not He Who has created know And He is the Most Kind and Courteous, All-Aware.
67|15|He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you; so walk in the paths thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the resurrection.
67|16|Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake
67|17|Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not send against you a Hasib Then you shall know how has been My warning.
67|18|And indeed those before them rejected, then how terrible was My reproach
67|19|Do they not see the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in None upholds them except the Most Gracious. Verily, He is the All-Seer of everything.
67|20|Who is it besides the Most Gracious that can be an army to you to help you The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion.
67|21|Who is it that can provide for you if He should withhold His provision Nay, but they continue to be in pride, and flee.
67|22|Is he who walks prone on his face, more rightly guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path
67|23|Say: "It is He Who has created you, and endowed you with hearing and seeing, and hearts. Little thanks you give."
67|24|Say: "It is He Who has created you on the earth, and to Him shall you be gathered."
67|25|They say: "When will this promise come to pass, if you are telling the truth"
67|26|Say: "The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am only a plain warner."
67|27|But when they will see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be sad and grievous, and it will be said: "This is what you were calling for!"
67|28|Say: "Tell me! If Allah destroys me, and those with me, or He bestows His mercy on us - who can save the disbelievers from a painful torment"
67|29|Say: "He is the Most Gracious, in Him we believe, and upon Him we rely. So, you will come to know who it is that is in manifest error."
67|30|Say: "Tell me! If (all) your water were to sink away, who then can supply you with flowing water"
