# Surah Al-Haqqah
Surah: Al-Haqqah | Chapter: 69

69|1|Al-Haqqah!
69|2|What is Al-Haqqah
69|3|And what will make you know what Al-Haqqah is
69|4|Thamud and `Ad denied the Qari`ah!
69|5|As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the Taghiyah!
69|6|And as for `Ad, they were destroyed by a wind, Sarsar `Atiyah!
69|7|Which Allah imposed on them for seven nights and eight days Husum, so that you could see men lying toppled, as if they were trunks of date palms, Khawiyah!
69|8|Do you see any remnants of them
69|9|And Fir`awn, and those before him, and the cities overthrown committed Al-Khati'ah.
69|10|And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, so He seized them with a punishment that was Rabiyah.
69|11|Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship.
69|12|That We might make it an admonition for you and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.
69|13|Then when the Trumpet will be blown with one blowing.
69|14|And the earth and the mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.
69|15|Then on that Day shall the Event occur.
69|16|And the heaven will be rent asunder, for that Day it will be frail and torn up.
69|17|And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.
69|18|That Day shall you be brought to Judgement, not a secret of you will be hidden.
69|19|Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand will say: "Here! read my Record!"
69|20|"Surely, I did believe that I shall meet my account!"
69|21|So, he shall be in a life, well-pleasing.
69|22|In a lofty Paradise,
69|23|The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.
69|24|Eat and drink at ease for that which you have sent on before you in days past!
69|25|But as for him who will be given his Record in his left hand, will say: "I wish that I had not been given my Record!"
69|26|"And that I had never known how my account is!"
69|27|"Would that it had been my end!"
69|28|"My wealth has not availed me;"
69|29|"My power has gone from me!"
69|30|(It will be said): "Seize him and fetter him;"
69|31|"Then throw him in the blazing Fire."
69|32|"Then fasten him on a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits!"
69|33|Verily, he used not to believe in Allah, the Most Great,
69|34|And urged not the feeding of the poor.
69|35|So, no friend has he here this Day,
69|36|Nor any food except filth from Ghislin.
69|37|None will eat it except the Khati'un.
69|38|So, I swear by whatsoever you see,
69|39|And by whatsoever you see not,
69|40|That this is verily the word of an honored Messenger.
69|41|It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe!
69|42|Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember!
69|43|This is the revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exists.
69|44|And if he had forged a false saying concerning Us,
69|45|We surely would have seized him by his right hand,
69|46|And then We certainly would have cut off Al-Watin from him,
69|47|And none of you could have prevented it from him.
69|48|And verily, this is a Reminder for those who have Taqwa.
69|49|And verily, We know that there are some among you that deny.
69|50|And indeed it will be an anguish for the disbelievers.
69|51|And verily, it (this Qur'an) is an absolute truth with certainty.
69|52|So, glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
