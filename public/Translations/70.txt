# Surah Al-Maarij
Surah: Al-Maarij | Chapter: 70

70|1|A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall
70|2|Upon the disbelievers, which none can avert,
70|3|From Allah, the Lord of the ways of ascent.
70|4|The angels and the Ruh ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.
70|5|So be patient, with a good patience.
70|6|Verily, they see it (the torment) afar off.
70|7|But We see it near.
70|8|The Day that the sky will be like the Al-Muhl.
70|9|And the mountains will be like `Ihn.
70|10|And no friend will ask a friend,
70|11|Though they shall be made to see one another, the criminal would desire to ransom himself from the punishment of that Day by his children.
70|12|And his wife and his brother,
70|13|And his Fasilah who sheltered him,
70|14|And all that are in the earth, so that it might save him.
70|15|By no means! Verily, it will be the fire of Hell,
70|16|Nazza`ah the Shawa!
70|17|Calling (all) such as turn their backs and turn away their faces.
70|18|And collect (wealth) and hide it (from spending it in the cause of Allah).
70|19|Verily, man was created very impatient;
70|20|Apprehensive when evil touches him;
70|21|And suppressive when good touches him.
70|22|Except those who are devoted to Salah.
70|23|Those who with their Salah are Da'imun;
70|24|And those in whose wealth there is a recognized right.
70|25|For the one who asks, and for the deprived.
70|26|And those who believe in the Day of Recompense.
70|27|And those who fear the torment of their Lord.
70|28|Verily, the torment of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure.
70|29|And those who guard their private part (chastity).
70|30|Except from their wives or their right hand possessions -- for (then) they are not blameworthy.
70|31|But whosoever seeks beyond that, then it is those who are trespassers.
70|32|And those who keep their trusts and covenants.
70|33|And those who stand firm in their testimonies.
70|34|And those who are with their Salah, Yuhafizun.
70|35|Such shall dwell in the Gardens, honored
70|36|So, what is the matter with those disbelievers, before you Muhti`in
70|37|On the right and on the left, `Izin.
70|38|Does every man of them hope to enter the Paradise of Delight
70|39|But no! Verily, We have created them out of that which they know!
70|40|But no! I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that surely We are Able
70|41|To replace them by (others) better than them; and We are not to be outrun.
70|42|So, leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about, until they meet their Day which they are promised.
70|43|The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to a Nusub,
70|44|With their eyes lowered in fear and humility, ignominy covering them (all over)! That is the Day which they were promised!
