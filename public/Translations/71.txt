# Surah Nuh
Surah: Nuh | Chapter: 71

71|1|Verily, We sent Nuh to his people (saying): "Warn your people before there comes to them a painful torment."
71|2|He said: "O my people! Verily, I am a plain warner to you,"
71|3|"That you should worship Allah, and have Taqwa of Him, and obey me,"
71|4|"He will forgive you of your sins and respite you to an appointed term. Verily, the term of Allah when it comes, cannot be delayed, if you but know."
71|5|He said: O my Lord! Verily, I have called to my people night and day,
71|6|But all my calling added nothing but to (their) flight.
71|7|And verily, every time I called unto them that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves up with their garments, and persisted, and magnified themselves in pride.
71|8|Then verily, I called to them openly (aloud).
71|9|Then verily, I proclaimed to them in public, and I have appealed to them in private.
71|10|I said (to them): Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft-Forgiving;
71|11|He will send rain to you Midrar,
71|12|And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.
71|13|What is the matter with you, that you do not hope for any Waqar from Allah
71|14|While He has created you (in) Atwar (stages).
71|15|See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens in tiers
71|16|And has made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp
71|17|And Allah has brought you forth from the (dust of) earth
71|18|Afterwards He will return you into it (the earth), and bring you forth.
71|19|And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse.
71|20|That you may go about therein in broad roads.
71|21|Nuh said: "My Lord! They have disobeyed me, and followed one whose wealth and children give him no increase but loss."
71|22|"And they have plotted a mighty plot."
71|23|"And they have said: `You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwa`, nor Yaghuth, and Ya`uq and Nasr.' "
71|24|"And indeed they have led many astray. And (O Allah): `Grant no increase to the wrongdoers save error."'
71|25|Because of their sins they were drowned, then were made to enter the Fire. And they found none to help them instead of Allah.
71|26|And Nuh said: "My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth Dayyar!"
71|27|"If You leave them, they will mislead Your servants, and they will beget none but wicked disbelievers."
71|28|"My Lord! Forgive me, and my parents, and him who enters my home as a believer, and all the believing men and women. And to the wrongdoers grant You no increase but destruction!") Allah says,
