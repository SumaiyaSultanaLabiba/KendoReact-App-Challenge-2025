# Surah Al-Jinn
Surah: Al-Jinn | Chapter: 72

72|1|Say: "It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened. They said: `Verily, we have heard a wonderful Recitation!'
72|2|`It guides to the right path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join anything with our Lord.'
72|3|`And He, exalted be the Jadd of our Lord, has taken neither a wife nor a son.'
72|4|`And that the foolish among us used to utter against Allah that which was an enormity in falsehood.'
72|5|`And verily, we thought that men and Jinn would not utter a lie against Allah.'
72|6|`And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq.'
72|7|`And they thought as you thought, that Allah will not send any Messenger.'
72|8|`And we have sought to reach the heaven; but we found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires.'
72|9|`And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush.'
72|10|`And we know not whether evil is intended for those on the earth, or whether their Lord intends for them guidance.'
72|11|`There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups having different ways.'
72|12|`And we think that we cannot escape Allah in the earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.'
72|13|`And indeed when we heard the Guidance, we believed therein, and whosoever believes in his Lord shall have no fear, either of a decrease in the reward of his good deeds or an increase in the punishment for his sins.'
72|14|`And of us some are Muslims, and of us some are Al-Qasitun. And whosoever has embraced Islam, then such have sought the right path.' "
72|15|And as for the Qasitun, they shall be firewood for Hell.
72|16|If they had believed in Allah, and went on the way, We would surely have bestowed on them water in abundance.
72|17|That We might try them thereby. And whosoever turns away from the Reminder of his Lord, He will cause him to enter in a Sa`ad torment.
72|18|And the Masjids are for Allah, so invoke not anyone along with Allah.
72|19|And when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.
72|20|Say: "I invoke only my Lord, and I associate none as partners along with Him."
72|21|Say: "It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the right path."
72|22|Say: "None can protect me from Allah's punishment, nor can I find refuge except in Him."
72|23|"(Mine is) but conveyance from Allah and His Messages, and whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever."
72|24|Till, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who it is that is weaker concerning helpers and less important concerning numbers.
72|25|Say: "I know not whether that which you are promised is near or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term."
72|26|"The All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen."
72|27|Except to a Messenger whom He has chosen, and then He makes a band of watching guards to march before him and behind him.
72|28|Till he knows that they have conveyed the Messages of their Lord. And He surrounds all that which is with them, and He keeps count of all things.
