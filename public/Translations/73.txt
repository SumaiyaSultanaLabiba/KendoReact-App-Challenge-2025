# Surah Al-Mujjammil
Surah: Al-Mujjammil | Chapter: 73

73|1|O you wrapped up!
73|2|Stand (to pray) all night, except a little.
73|3|Half of it or less than that, a little.
73|4|Or a little more. And Rattil the Qur'an Tartil.
73|5|Verily, We shall send down to you a Word Thaqil.
73|6|Verily, rising (Nashi'ah) at night is better for understanding and more suitable for speech (recitation).
73|7|Verily, for you in the day is lengthy Sabh.
73|8|And remember the Name of your Lord and (Tabattil) devote yourself to Him with complete devotion.
73|9|Lord of the east and the west; La ilaha illa Huwa, so take Him as a trustee.
73|10|And be patient with what they say, and keep away from them in a good way.
73|11|And leave Me alone to deal with the deniers, those who are in possession of good things of life. And give them respite for a little.
73|12|Verily, with Us are Ankal, and Jahim.
73|13|And a food that chokes, and a painful torment.
73|14|On the Day when the earth and the mountains will (Tarjufu) shake, and the mountains will be a heap of sand poured out.
73|15|Verily, We have sent to you a Messenger to be a witness over you, as We did send a Messenger to Fir`awn.
73|16|But Fir`awn disobeyed the Messenger; so We seized him with a severe punishment.
73|17|Then how can you protect yourselves from the punishment, if you disbelieve, on a Day that will make the children gray-headed
73|18|Whereon the heaven will be cleft asunder His promise is certainly to be accomplished.
73|19|Verily, this is an admonition, therefore whosoever wills, let him take a path to His Lord!
73|20|Verily, your Lord knows that you do stand a little less than two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and also a party of those with you. And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to pray the whole night, so He has turned to you. So, recite you of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you. He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty, yet others fighting in Allah's cause. So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy,
