# Surah Al-Qiyamah
Surah: Al-Qiyamah | Chapter: 75

75|1|Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
75|2|And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.
75|3|Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones
75|4|Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.
75|5|Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.
75|6|He asks: "When will be this Day of Resurrection"
75|7|So, when Bariqa the sight.
75|8|And the moon will be eclipsed.
75|9|And the sun and moon will be joined together.
75|10|On that Day man will say: "Where (is the refuge) to flee"
75|11|No! There is no refuge!
75|12|Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.
75|13|On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.
75|14|Nay! Man will be well informed about himself,
75|15|Though he may put forth his excuses.
75|16|Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.
75|17|It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.
75|18|And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.
75|19|Then it is for Us to make it clear.
75|20|But no! Rather you love the present life of this world,
75|21|And neglect the Hereafter.
75|22|Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.
75|23|Looking at their Lord.
75|24|And some faces that Day will be Basirah,
75|25|Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.
75|26|Nay, when it rea- ches to the collarbones.
75|27|And it will be said: "Who can cure him"
75|28|And he will think that it was the parting;
75|29|And one shank will be joined with another shank.
75|30|The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!
75|31|So, he neither believed nor prayed!
75|32|But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!
75|33|Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!
75|34|Woe to you! And then woe to you!
75|35|Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!
75|36|Does man think that he will be left neglected
75|37|Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted
75|38|Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.
75|39|And made of him two sexes, male and female.
75|40|Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead
