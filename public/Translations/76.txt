# Surah Al-Insan
Surah: Al-Insan | Chapter: 76

76|1|Has there not been over man a period of time, when he was not a thing worth mentioning
76|2|Verily, We have created man from Nutfah Amshaj, in order to try him, so, We made him hearer and seer.
76|3|Verily, We guided him to the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.
76|4|Verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains, iron collars, and Sa`ir.
76|5|Verily, the Abrar (righteous believers) shall drink of a cup mixed with Kafur.
76|6|A spring wherefrom the servants of Allah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly.
76|7|They fulfill (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil will be wide-spreading.
76|8|And they give food, inspite of their love for it, to the poor, the orphan and the captive,
76|9|(Saying): "We feed you seeking Allah's Face only. We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you."
76|10|"Verily, We fear from our Lord a Day that is `Abus and Qamtarir."
76|11|So, Allah saved them from the evil of that Day, and gave them Nadrah (a light of beauty) and joy.
76|12|And their recompense shall be Paradise, and silken garments, because they were patient.
76|13|Reclining therein on raised couches, they will see there neither the excessive heat, nor the excessive cold.
76|14|And the shade thereof is close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach.
76|15|And among them will be passed round vessels of silver and cups of crystal --
76|16|(Qawarir) Crystal-clear, made of silver. They will determine the measure thereof.
76|17|And they will be given to drink there of a cup (of wine) mixed with Zanjabil (ginger),
76|18|A spring there, called Salsabil.
76|19|And round about them will (serve) boys of everlasting youth. If you see them, you would think them scattered pearls.
76|20|And when you look there (in Paradise), you will see a delight (that cannot be imagined), and a great dominion.
76|21|Their garments will be of fine green silk, and Istabraq. They will be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a purifying drink.
76|22|(And it will be said to them): "Verily, this is a reward for you, and your endeavor has been accepted."
76|23|Verily, it is We Who have sent down the Qur'an to you by stages.
76|24|Therefore be patient with constancy to the command of your Lord, and obey neither a sinner nor a disbeliever among them.
76|25|And remember the Name of your Lord every morning and afternoon.
76|26|And during the night, prostrate yourself to Him, and glorify Him a long night through.
76|27|Verily, these love the present life of this world, and put behind them a heavy Day.
76|28|It is We Who created them, and We have made them of strong build. And when We will, We can replace them with others like them with a complete replacement.
76|29|Verily, this is an admonition, so whosoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord.
76|30|But you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Verily, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.
76|31|He will admit to His mercy whom He wills and as for the wrongdoers -- He has prepared a painful torment.
