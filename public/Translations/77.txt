# Surah Al-Mursalat
Surah: Al-Mursalat | Chapter: 77

77|1|By the Mursalat `Urfa.
77|2|The `Asifat `Asfa.
77|3|And the Nashirat Nashra.
77|4|The Fariqat that separate.
77|5|The Mulqiyat that remind,
77|6|Excusing or warning.
77|7|Surely, what you are promised will occur.
77|8|Then when the stars lose their lights.
77|9|And when Furijat the heaven.
77|10|And when the mountains are blown away.
77|11|And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.
77|12|For what Day are these signs postponed
77|13|For the Day of Sorting Out (the men of Paradise from the men destined for Hell).
77|14|And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out
77|15|Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!
77|16|Did We not destroy the ancients
77|17|So shall We make later generations to follow them.
77|18|Thus do We deal with the criminals.
77|19|Woe that Day to the deniers!
77|20|Did We not create you from a despised water
77|21|Then We placed it in a place of safety,
77|22|For a known period
77|23|So We did measure; and We are the best to measure.
77|24|Woe that Day to the deniers!
77|25|Have We not made the earth Kifat (a receptacle)
77|26|For the living and the dead
77|27|And have placed therein fixed towers, and have given you Furat water
77|28|Woe that Day to the deniers!
77|29|(It will be said to the disbelievers): "Depart you to that which you used to deny!"
77|30|"Depart you to a shadow in three columns,"
77|31|"Neither shady nor of any use against the fierce flame of the Fire."
77|32|Verily, it (Hell) throws sparks (huge) as Al-Qasr,
77|33|As if they were Sufr camels.
77|34|Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!
77|35|That will be a Day when they shall not speak (during some part of it),
77|36|And they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse.
77|37|Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!
77|38|That will be a Day of Decision! We have brought you and the men of old together!
77|39|So, if you have a plot, use it against Me (Allah)!
77|40|Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!
77|41|Verily, those who had Taqwa, shall be amidst shades and springs.
77|42|And fruits, such as they desire.
77|43|"Eat and drink comfortably for that which you used to do."
77|44|Verily, thus We reward the Muhsinin.
77|45|Woe that Day to the deniers!
77|46|Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while. Verily, you are criminals.
77|47|Woe that Day to the deniers!
77|48|And when it is said to them: "Bow down yourself!" They bow not down.
77|49|Woe that Day to the deniers!
77|50|Then in what statement after this will they believe
