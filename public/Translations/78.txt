# Surah An-Naba
Surah: An-Naba | Chapter: 78

78|1|What are they asking about
78|2|About the great news,
78|3|About which they are in disagreement.
78|4|Nay, they will come to know!
78|5|Nay, again, they will come to know!
78|6|Have We not made the earth as a bed,
78|7|And the mountains as pegs
78|8|And We have created you in pairs.
78|9|And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest.
78|10|And We have made the night as a covering,
78|11|And We have made the day for livelihood.
78|12|And We have built above you seven strong,
78|13|And We have made (therein) a shining lamp.
78|14|And We have sent down from the Mu`sirat water Thajjaj.
78|15|That We may produce therewith grains and vegetations,
78|16|And gardens that are Alfaf.
78|17|Verily, the Day of Decision is a fixed time,
78|18|The Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and you shall come forth in crowds.
78|19|And the heaven shall be opened, and it will become as gates.
78|20|And the mountains shall be moved away from their places and they will be as if they were a mirage.
78|21|Truly, Hell is a place of ambush
78|22|A dwelling place for the Taghun,
78|23|They will abide therein Ahqab.
78|24|Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink.
78|25|Except Hamim, and Ghassaq
78|26|An exact recompense (according to their evil crimes).
78|27|For verily, they used not to look for a reckoning.
78|28|But they denied Our Ayat Kidhdhaba.
78|29|And all things We have recorded in a Book.
78|30|So taste you. No increase shall We give you, except in torment.
78|31|Verily, for those who have Taqwa, there will be a success;
78|32|Hada'iq and vineyards,
78|33|And Kawa`ib Atrab,
78|34|And a cup Dihaq.
78|35|No Laghw shall they hear therein, nor lying;
78|36|Rewarded from your Lord with a sufficient gift.
78|37|The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and whatsoever is in between them, the Most Gracious, with Whom th- ey cannot dare to speak.
78|38|The Day that Ar-Ruh and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom Ar-Rahman allows, and he will speak what is right.
78|39|That is the True Day. So, whosoever wills, let him seek a place with His Lord!
78|40|Verily, We have warned you of a near torment -- the Day when man will see that which his hands have sent forth, and the disbeliever will say: "Woe to me! Would that I were dust!"
