# Surah An-Naziat
Surah: An-Naziat | Chapter: 79

79|1|By those who pull out, drowning.
79|2|By those who free briskly.
79|3|And by the swimmers, swimming.
79|4|And by the racers, racing.
79|5|And by those who arrange affairs.
79|6|On the Day the Rajifah shakes,
79|7|Followed by the Radifah.
79|8|Hearts that Day will tremble.
79|9|Their vision humiliated.
79|10|They say: "Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah"
79|11|"Even after we are bones Nakhirah"
79|12|They say: "It would in that case, be a return with loss!"
79|13|But it will be only a single Zajrah.
79|14|When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.
79|15|Has there come to you the story of Musa
79|16|When his Lord called him in the holy valley of Tuwa,
79|17|Go to Fir`awn; verily, he has transgressed all bounds.
79|18|And say to him: "Would you purify yourself"
79|19|"And that I guide you to your Lord, so you should fear Him"
79|20|Then he showed him the great sign.
79|21|But he denied and disobeyed.
79|22|Then he turned back, striving.
79|23|So he gathered and called out,
79|24|Saying: "I am your lord, most high."
79|25|So Allah seized him with punishing example for the Hereafter and the first (life).
79|26|In this is a lesson for whoever fears.
79|27|Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed
79|28|He raised its hei- ght, and has perfected it.
79|29|Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.
79|30|And after that He spread the earth,
79|31|And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture.
79|32|And the mountains He has fixed firmly,
79|33|As provision and benefit for you and your cattle.
79|34|But when there comes the Greatest Catastrophe
79|35|The Day when man shall remember what he strove for.
79|36|And Hell shall be made apparent for whoever sees.
79|37|Then for him who transgressed
79|38|And preferred the life of this world,
79|39|Verily, his abode will be the Hell;
79|40|But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and forbade himself from desire.
79|41|Verily, Paradise will be his abode.
79|42|They ask you about the Hour when will be its appointed time
79|43|What do you have to mention of it.
79|44|To your Lord it is limited.
79|45|You are only a warner for those who fear it,
79|46|The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.
