# Surah Al-Abasa
Surah: Al-Abasa | Chapter: 80

80|1|He frowned and turned away.
80|2|Because there came to him the blind man.
80|3|And how can you know that he might become pure
80|4|Or he might receive admonition, and the admonition might profit him
80|5|As for him who thinks himself self-sufficient,
80|6|To him you attend;
80|7|What does it matter to you if he will not become pure
80|8|But as for him who came to you running,
80|9|And is afraid.
80|10|Of him you are neglectful and divert your attention to another.
80|11|Nay; indeed it is an admonition.
80|12|So, whoever wills, let him pay attention to Him (it).
80|13|In Records held in honor,
80|14|Exalted, purified.
80|15|In the hands of ambassadors (Safarah),
80|16|Honorable and obedient.
80|17|Qutila mankind! How ungrateful he is!
80|18|From what thing did He create him
80|19|From a Nutfah He created him and then set him in due proportion.
80|20|Then He made the path easy for him.
80|21|Then He causes him to die and puts him in his grave.
80|22|Then when it is His will, He will resurrect him.
80|23|Nay, but has not done what He commanded him.
80|24|Then let man look at his food:
80|25|We pour forth water in abundance.
80|26|And We split the earth in clefts.
80|27|And We cause therein Habb to grow,
80|28|And grapes and Qadb,
80|29|And olives and date palms,
80|30|And Ghulb Hada'iq,
80|31|And fruits (Fakihah) and herbage (Abb).
80|32|A provision and benefit for you and your cattle.
80|33|Then when there comes As-Sakhkhah
80|34|That Day shall a man flee from his brother.
80|35|And from his mother and his father.
80|36|And from his wife and his children.
80|37|Every man that Day will have enough to make him careless of others.
80|38|Some faces that Day will be bright,
80|39|Laughing, rejoicing at good news.
80|40|And other faces that Day will be dust-stained.
80|41|Darkness will cover them.
80|42|Such will be the disbelieving, the wicked evil doers.
