# Surah At-Takwir
Surah: At-Takwir | Chapter: 81

81|1|When the sun is Kuwwirat.
81|2|And when the stars Inkadarat.
81|3|And when the mountains are made to pass away;
81|4|And when the pregnant she-camels are neglected;
81|5|And when the wild beasts are gathered together.
81|6|And when the seas become as blazing fire.
81|7|And when the souls are joined with their mates.
81|8|And when the female infant (Al-Maw'udah) buried alive is questioned (Su'ilat):
81|9|For what sin was she killed
81|10|And when the pages are laid open.
81|11|And when the heaven is Kushitat;
81|12|And when Hell is Su`irat.
81|13|And when Paradise is brought near.
81|14|Every person will know what he has brought.
81|15|But nay! I swear by Al-Khunnas.
81|16|Al-Jawar Al-Kunnas.
81|17|And by the night when it `As`as.
81|18|And by the day when it Tanaffas.
81|19|Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger.
81|20|Dhi Quwwah, with the Lord of the Throne -- Makin,
81|21|Obeyed there, trustworthy.
81|22|And your companion is not a madman.
81|23|And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.
81|24|And he withholds not a knowledge of the Unseen.
81|25|And it is not the word of the outcast Shaytan.
81|26|Then where are you going
81|27|Verily, this is no less than a Reminder for the creatures.
81|28|To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.
81|29|And you cannot will unless that Allah wills -- the Lord of all that exists.
