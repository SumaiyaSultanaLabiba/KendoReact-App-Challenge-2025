# Surah Al-Infitar
Surah: Al-Infitar | Chapter: 82

82|1|When the heaven is cleft asunder (Infatarat).
82|2|And when the stars Intatharat.
82|3|And when the seas Fujjirat.
82|4|And when the graves Bu`thirat.
82|5|A person will know what he has sent forward and left behind.
82|6|O man! What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous
82|7|Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion.
82|8|In whatever form He willed, He put you together.
82|9|Nay! But you deny (the Day of) Ad-Din.
82|10|But verily, over you to watch you
82|11|Kiraman Katibin,
82|12|They know all that you do.
82|13|Verily, the Abrar (the righteous believers) will be in Delight;
82|14|And verily, the wicked will be in the blazing Fire (Hell),
82|15|Therein they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense,
82|16|And they will not be absent therefrom.
82|17|And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is
82|18|Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is
82|19|(It will be) the Day when no person shall have power for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be with Allah.
