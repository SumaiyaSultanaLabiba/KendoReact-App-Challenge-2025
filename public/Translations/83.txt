# Surah At-Tatfif
Surah: At-Tatfif | Chapter: 83

83|1|Woe to Al-Mutaffifin.
83|2|Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure,
83|3|And when they have to give by measure or weight to men, give less than due.
83|4|Do they not think that they will be resurrected,
83|5|On a Great Day
83|6|The Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists
83|7|Nay! Truly, the Record of the wicked is in Sijjin.
83|8|And what will make you know what Sijjin is
83|9|A Register inscribed.
83|10|Woe, that Day, to those who deny.
83|11|Those who deny the Day of Recompense.
83|12|And none can deny it except every transgressor beyond bounds, the sinner!
83|13|When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: "Tales of the ancients!"
83|14|Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.
83|15|Nay! Surely, they will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.
83|16|Then verily, they will indeed enter the burning flame of Hell.
83|17|Then, it will be said to them: "This is what you used to deny!"
83|18|Nay! Verily, the Record of Al-Abrar (the righteous believers) is (preserved) in `Illiyyin.
83|19|And what will make you know what `Illiyyin is
83|20|A Register inscribed,
83|21|To which bear witness those nearest.
83|22|Verily, Al-Abrar (the righteous believers) will be in Delight.
83|23|On thrones, looking.
83|24|You will recognize in their faces the brightness of delight.
83|25|They will be given to drink of pure sealed Rahiq.
83|26|Sealed with musk, and for this let those strive who want to strive.
83|27|It will be mixed with Tasnim:
83|28|A spring whereof drink those nearest to Allah.
83|29|Verily, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed.
83|30|And, whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to another.
83|31|And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting;
83|32|And when they saw them, they said: "Verily, these have indeed gone astray!"
83|33|But they were not sent as watchers over them.
83|34|But this Day those who believe will laugh at the disbelievers
83|35|On thrones, looking.
83|36|Are not the disbelievers paid for what they used to do
