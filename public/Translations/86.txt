# Surah At-Tariq
Surah: At-Tariq | Chapter: 86

86|1|By the heaven, and At-Tariq;
86|2|And what will make you to know what At-Tariq is
86|3|The star, Ath-Thaqib.
86|4|There is no human being but has a protector over him.
86|5|So, let man see from what he is created!
86|6|He is created from a water gushing forth,
86|7|Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.
86|8|Verily, He is Able to bring him back!
86|9|The Day when all the secrets will be examined.
86|10|Then he will have no power, nor any helper.
86|11|By the sky which gives rain, again and again.
86|12|And the earth which splits.
86|13|Verily, this is the Word that separates.
86|14|And it is not a thing for amusement.
86|15|Verily, they are but plotting a plot.
86|16|And I am planning a plan.
86|17|So, give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while.
