# Surah Al-Ala
Surah: Al-Ala | Chapter: 87

87|1|Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.
87|2|Who has created, and then proportioned it.
87|3|And Who has measured; and then guided.
87|4|And Who brings out the pasturage,
87|5|And then makes it dark stubble.
87|6|We shall make you recite, so you shall not forget,
87|7|Except what Allah may will He knows what is apparent and what is hidden.
87|8|And We shall make easy for you the easy.
87|9|Therefore remind in case the reminder profits.
87|10|The reminder will be received by him who fears,
87|11|But it will be avoided by the wretched,
87|12|Who will enter the great Fire.
87|13|There he will neither die nor live.
87|14|Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success.
87|15|And remembers the Name of his Lord, and performs Salah.
87|16|Rather you prefer the life of this world.
87|17|Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
87|18|Verily, this is in the former Scriptures
87|19|The Scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa.
