# Surah Al-Ghashiyah
Surah: Al-Ghashiyah | Chapter: 88

88|1|Has there come to you the narration of Al-Ghashiyah (the overwhelming)
88|2|Some faces that Day will be Khashi`ah.
88|3|Laboring, weary.
88|4|They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah.
88|5|They will be given to drink from a boiling (Aniyah) spring,
88|6|No food will there be for them but from Dari`,
88|7|Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.
88|8|Faces that Day will be joyful,
88|9|Glad with their endeavor.
88|10|In a lofty Paradise.
88|11|Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.
88|12|Therein will be a running spring.
88|13|Therein will be thrones raised high.
88|14|And cups set at hand.
88|15|And Namariq, set in rows.
88|16|And Zarabi, spread out (Mabthuthah).
88|17|Do they not look at the camels, how they are created
88|18|And at the heaven, how it is raised
88|19|And at the mountains, how they are rooted
88|20|And at the earth, how it is outspread
88|21|So remind them -- you are only one who reminds.
88|22|You are not a Musaytir over them.
88|23|Save the one who turns away and disbelieves.
88|24|Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.
88|25|Verily, to Us will be their return;
88|26|Then verily, for Us will be their reckoning.
