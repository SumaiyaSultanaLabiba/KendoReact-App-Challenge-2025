# Surah Al-Fajr
Surah: Al-Fajr | Chapter: 89

89|1|By the dawn;
89|2|And by the ten nights,
89|3|And by the even and the odd.
89|4|And by the night when it departs.
89|5|Is there (not) in them sufficient proofs for men of understanding!
89|6|Saw you not how your Lord dealt with `Ad
89|7|Iram of the pillars,
89|8|The like of which were not created in the land
89|9|And Thamud, who hewed out rocks in the valley
89|10|And Fir`awn with Al-Awtad
89|11|Who did transgress beyond bounds in the lands.
89|12|And made therein much mischief.
89|13|So, your Lord poured on them different kinds of severe torment.
89|14|Verily, your Lord is Ever Watchful.
89|15|As for man, when his Lord tries him by giving him honor and bounties, then he says: "My Lord has honored me."
89|16|But when He tries him by straitening his means of life, he says: "My Lord has humiliated me!"
89|17|But no! But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity!
89|18|And urge not one another on the feeding of the Miskin!
89|19|And you devour the Turath -- devouring with greed.
89|20|And you love wealth with love Jamma.
89|21|Nay! When the earth is flatened, Dakkan Dakka.
89|22|And your Lord comes with the angels in rows.
89|23|And Hell will be brought near that Day. On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance avail him
89|24|He will say: "Alas! Would that I had sent forth for my life!"
89|25|So on that Day none will punish as He will punish.
89|26|And none will bind as He will bind.
89|27|"O tranquil soul!"
89|28|"Come back to your Lord, -- well-pleased and well-pleasing!"
89|29|"Enter then among My servants,"
89|30|"And enter My Paradise!"
