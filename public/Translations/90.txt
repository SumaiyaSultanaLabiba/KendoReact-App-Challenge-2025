# Surah Al-Balad
Surah: Al-Balad | Chapter: 90

90|1|Nay! I swear by this city;
90|2|And you are free in this city.
90|3|And by the begetter and that which he begot.
90|4|Verily, We have created man in Kabad.
90|5|Does he think that none can overcome him
90|6|He says: "I have wasted wealth in abundance!"
90|7|Does he think that none sees him
90|8|Have We not made for him two eyes
90|9|And a tongue and two lips
90|10|And shown him the two ways
90|11|But he has not attempted to pass on the path that is steep.
90|12|And what will make you know the path that is steep
90|13|Freeing a neck
90|14|Or giving food in a day full of Masghabah,
90|15|To an orphan near of kin.
90|16|Or to a Miskin cleaving to dust.
90|17|Then he became one of those who believed and recommended one another to patience, and recommended one another to compassion.
90|18|They are those on the Right,
90|19|But those who disbelieved in Our Ayat, they are those on the Left.
90|20|Upon them Fire will Mu'sadah.
