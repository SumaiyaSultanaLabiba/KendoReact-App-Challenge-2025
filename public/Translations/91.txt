# Surah Ash-Shams
Surah: Ash-Shams | Chapter: 91

91|1|By the sun and Duhaha.
91|2|By the moon as it Talaha.
91|3|By the day as it Jallaha.
91|4|By the night as it Yaghshaha.
91|5|By the heaven and Ma Banaha.
91|6|By the earth and Ma Tahhaha.
91|7|By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it).
91|8|Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.
91|9|Indeed he succeeds who purifies it.
91|10|And indeed he fails who Dassaha.
91|11|Thamud denied through their trans- gression.
91|12|When their most wicked went forth.
91|13|But the Messenger of Allah said to them: "Be cautious! That is the she-camel of Allah! (Do not harm it) and (bar it not from having) its drink!"
91|14|Then they denied him and they killed it. So their Lord destroyed them because of their sin, Fasawwaha!
91|15|And He feared not the consequences thereof.
