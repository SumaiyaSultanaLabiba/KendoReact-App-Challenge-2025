# Surah Al-Lail
Surah: Al-Lail | Chapter: 92

92|1|By the night as it envelops.
92|2|By the day as it appears.
92|3|By Him Who created male and female.
92|4|Certainly, your efforts and deeds are diverse.
92|5|As for him who gives and has Taqwa,
92|6|And believes in Al-Husna.
92|7|We will make smooth for him the path of ease.
92|8|But he who is greedy and thinks himself self-sufficient,
92|9|And denies Al-Husna.
92|10|We will make smooth for him the path to evil.
92|11|And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)
92|12|Truly, on Us is (to give) guidance.
92|13|And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).
92|14|Therefore I have warned you of a Fire Talazza.
92|15|None shall enter it save the most wretched.
92|16|Who denies and turns away.
92|17|And those with Taqwa will be far removed from it.
92|18|He who gives of his wealth for self-purification.
92|19|And who has (in mind) no favor from anyone to be paid back.
92|20|Except to seek the Face of his Lord, the Most High.
92|21|He, surely, will be pleased.
