# Surah Ad-Duha
Surah: Ad-Duha | Chapter: 93

93|1|By the forenoon.
93|2|By the night when it darkens.
93|3|Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hates you.
93|4|And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present.
93|5|And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.
93|6|Did He not find you an orphan and gave you a refuge
93|7|And He found you unaware and guided you
93|8|And He found you poor and made you rich
93|9|Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression.
93|10|And repulse not the one who asks.
93|11|And proclaim the grace of your Lord.
