# Surah Al-Alaq
Surah: Al-Alaq | Chapter: 96

96|1|Read! In the Name of your Lord Who created.
96|2|He has created man from a clot.
96|3|Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.
96|4|Who has taught by the pen.
96|5|He has taught man that which he knew not.
96|6|Nay! Verily, man does transgress.
96|7|Because he considers himself self-sufficient.
96|8|Surely, unto your Lord is the return.
96|9|Have you seen him who prevents
96|10|A servant when he prays
96|11|Have you seen if he is on the guidance
96|12|Or enjoins Taqwa
96|13|Have you seen if he denies and turns away
96|14|Knows he not that Allah sees
96|15|Nay! If he ceases not, We will scorch his forehead --
96|16|A lying, sinful forehead!
96|17|Then let him call upon his council.
96|18|We will call out the guards of Hell!
96|19|Nay! Do not obey him. Fall prostrate and draw near (to Allah)!
