Surah: Al-Qadr | Chapter: 97

97|1|Verily, We have sent it down in the Night of Al-Qadr.
97|2|And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is
97|3|The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.
97|4|Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord's permission with every matter.
97|5|There is peace until the appearance of dawn.
