# Surah Al-Zilzal
Surah: Al-Zilzal | Chapter: 99

99|1|When the earth quakes with its Zilzal.
99|2|And when the earth throws out its burdens.
99|3|And man will say: "What is the matter with it"
99|4|That Day it will declare its information.
99|5|Because your Lord will inspire it.
99|6|That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds.
99|7|So, whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.
99|8|And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.
